The divine power within knows exactly who you are!
With a pure heart, you are balanced in life.
You are not afraid to admit when you are wrong.
The truth springs forth from your mind.
Today, you use your power to stop what is no longer good for you.
The only way to freedom is through truth.
You accept you as you are.
You are free, hallelujah!
You are as great as you think you are.
When you know yourself, you stop doing what is not good for you.
You honor your feelings no matter what they are.
Today, you are a child again.
You will not hide who you are.
You acknowledge, accept, and embrace everything about you.
You are taking a stand for you.
You are sitting in a sacred place.
You are one with the spirit within.
What other people think about you is not your concern.
You look within for the answers you need.
You are okay with you.
There is no spot where God is not.
Today, you plan to choose and ask with an open mind.
You bless the spirit of your head and your mind.
You are a true believer in the best about you.
You are growing by thoughts, words, and deeds.
You are in control of your mind and your mouth.
You can do it.
You believe in the right to unlimited goodness in your life.
You take the time to develop your own mind.
