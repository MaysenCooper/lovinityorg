The divine power within knows exactly who you are!
With a pure heart, you are balanced in life.
You are not afraid to admit when you are wrong.
The truth springs forth from your mind.
Today, you use your power to stop what is no longer good for you.
The only way to freedom is through truth.
You are accepted as you are.
You are free, hallelujah!
You are as great as you think you are.
When you know yourself, you stop doing what is not good for you.
Your feelings are valid no matter what they are.
Today, you are a child again.
You do not have to hide who you are.
Acknowledge, accept, and embrace everything about you.
Take a stand for you.
You are sitting in a sacred place.
You are one with the spirit within.
What other people think about you is not your concern.
Look within for the answers you need.
You are okay!
There is no spot where God is not.
Today, plan to choose and ask with an open mind.
The spirit of your head and mind is blessed.
Believe in the best about you.
You grow by thoughts, words, and deeds.
You are in control of your mind and your mouth.
You can do it.
You have the right to unlimited goodness in your life.
You are taking the time to develop your own mind.
