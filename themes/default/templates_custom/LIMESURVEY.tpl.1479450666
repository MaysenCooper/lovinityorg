<h1>TLC+ Surveys</h1>
<b>Were you asked for a token?: </b>
If a survey asks for a token, and you do not have one, make note of the code in the survey's title (usually begins with "TOKEN_"). Then, go to <a href="https://lovinity.org/pointcode.htm" target="_blank">https://lovinity.org/pointcode.htm</a> and submit the code you noted to generate a token. If no code was provided, the survey is likely not open to the general public.<br />
