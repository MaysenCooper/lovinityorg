DOC_BANNERS=The banner system lets you set up one or more banners to display. It allows 'rotating' (randomising) these banners, with various related control options. The system is designed to be flexible, such that it can serve a number of different purposes, including:\n - Serving banners directly from a third-party banner network, via the [abbr="HyperText Markup Language"]HTML[/abbr] they provide for you to include in your site\n - Serving your own set of banners (perhaps paid banners, or perhaps community banners)\n - Serving community banners, bought via the Point Store\n - Creating your own banner network between independent sites, where sites get as many views/clicks out as they provide in (i.e. a banner exchange program)
