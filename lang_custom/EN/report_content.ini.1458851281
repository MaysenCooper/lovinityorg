REPORT_CONTENT=Report Content
DESCRIPTION_REPORT_CONTENT=You are making a report on &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;. You should only report content found to be in violation of our rules, terms, or policies (see About -> Rules). <br><br>Please be mindful of what you report. For example, if only a specific post in a forum topic is the problem and not the topic as a whole, report that post and not the whole topic. Reporting the topic could result in the entire topic being marked hidden instead of just the problematic post. <br /><br /> Please do not report content to notify staff you wish to have something locked/moved as doing so could unintentionally result in the content being marked hidden. Instead, please make a support ticket under About -> Support Tickets or emailing support@lovinity.org. <br><br> If {2} {2|person|people} report the content, it will be hidden automatically until staff review it.<br /><br />Please include your reasoning behind why the content you are reporting is in violation of our rules, terms, or policies. Include screenshots/attachments as necessary. Completion of this report will result in the creation of a support ticket with staff. If you file the report as a guest rather than a logged in user, be aware that staff will not have communication with you and therefore an inconclusive report will be tossed. <strong>All reports are kept confidential.</strong>
