DOC_WRITING=Pages can be edited with the [abbr="What You See Is What You Get"]WYSIWYG[/abbr] editor, but you can add in extra things such as blocks or text effects, using Comcode (that's what the square brackets are for).\n\n[surround][title="3"]A note on accessibility[/title]\n\nWhen writing for any kind of publication, it is important to use clear language which is appropriate for the audience you are targeting. Using good grammar and spelling not only makes your text correct, but most importantly, it makes it easier to read and understand - a small conscious effort will lead to a significant improvement for all your readers.\n\nFor your text to be accessible to those with certain kinds of disability, you should make sure:\n - colour is not used alone to convey information\n - text is well-spaced into logical paragraphs\n - if you are writing a long piece of text, consider using headings and an index (the software can maintain the index for you if you use the 'contents' Comcode tag)\n - Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs\n - Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, and lists, so that your text may be quickly understood on its first read\n - use clear, precise, and understandable language: avoid complex words unless there is a good reason for them[/surround]
DOC_PHPINFO='PHP info' displays information about the PHP server environment. This is based on a feature PHP itself provides, of the same name -- but we also add in some extra checks of our own, putting out warnings if software requirements are not met.\n\nInformation includes all the technical details of the PHP configuration, such as the installed PHP extensions and the defined options.\n\nSome PHP options can be defined in the '.htaccess' file (Apache non-CGI web server users only), as illustrated by the default [tt]recommended.htaccess[/tt] file. On CGI servers you need to use a custom [tt]php.ini[/tt] file instead (see our FAQ). Full details of this are in the [url="PHP manual"]http://uk.php.net//docs.php[/url].\n\nThe PHP info is also convenient for identifying wider factors of the system environment, such as server paths.
DOC_NETLINK=The linking of different installations, linked via a forum, into a 'multi-site-network' (an M.S.N.) is supported by this software. This is an important feature for networks of websites which share a common community, but are segmented, for reasons such as:\n - Division of staff, either on a hierarchical basis or a basis of co-operation by a loose-knit alliance of websites\n - Strong division of content, perhaps for sub-branding or clarity\n - A balance between autonomy and co-operation between websites that wish to share a visitor-base
DOC_STYLE=Presentation is key - without it, your website content and functionality are likely not to even be discovered. This section of the Admin Zone is where you can change the appearance of your website. Composr has exceptional themeing support, with a whole range of features from simple personalisation by filling in a few form fields, to advanced programming features to completely restructure the layout of your website.\n\n[b]You can find additional contextual style tools in the footer, where it says &lsquo;(Select page rendering tool)&rsquo;.[/b]
DOC_SETUP=In this section of the Admin Zone you will find tools to setup your website. This may be the area you spend most time in initially, but visit less and less over time. If this is your first visit, we recommend you use the 'Setup Wizard' to quickly set the most important options in a user-friendly way.\n\nComposr has a core system as well as addons: some of what you would consider essential to your website may be provided by addons (because what you might consider essential for your website might be considered unnecessary clutter for others). Official addons can be installed or uninstalled at any time, and (depending on experience) you can also install or make other addons as desired (the system is highly extendable).
DOC_SECURITY=This section allows you to modify all settings related to security (including staff, usergroups and censorship).\n\nThere is a vast array of settings here, particularly the 'Permissions tree editor', which you will find very useful for identifying and setting permissions across your whole website.\n\nThe developers take all security considerations very seriously, so many internal security mechanisms are provided that you shouldn't need to manually configure. Thus, they are not presented in this section.
DOC_CMS=The Content Management Zone is the place to manage most of the categories and entries on the system.\n\nA rough definition of what is considered content is anything you might expect to be readily added on-the-fly. Some forms of content are designed to be added from the main website (for example, comments and forum posts), so are not presented here.
