DOC_AWARDS=You may create awards based around most types of content, and then grant these awards out on a basis of your choosing. One award exists in the system by default: 'Download of the week'. Awards tie in with the YinYang system, so you may give the submitters of the awarded content some Yang as a prize.
DESCRIPTION_AWARD_POINTS=The Yang bounty awarded to the awardee.
