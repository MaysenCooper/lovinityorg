[strings]
DOC_EDIT_MEMBER=Member editing is done by browsing to the profile of that member and choosing a link from there. Member profiles contain a wealth of links, acting as the hub for member control and tracking.\n\nThis icon will direct you to the member list, which is outside of the Admin Zone.
DOC_SECONDARY_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP=Secondary usergroup membership editing is done by browsing to the usergroup you would like to control membership for and choosing an action from there.\n\nThis icon will direct you to the usergroups list, which is outside of the Admin Zone.
DOC_MERGE_MEMBERS=The ability to merge members is only of occasional use, but when you find you do need it, it can be a great help. The usual situation is that one member gets 'bored', feels 'victimised', or wants to go 'undercover' (often, talking with their other account to 'hide the fact'), and creates themselves a second username. This may be a violation of your rules, depending which you have chosen, but is often annoying; it can usually easily be noticed just by seeing that two members have the same personality, spelling and language habits, usage patterns and IP address.\n\nIt is worth noting, that you should not be overly suspicious, as members who share some of the listed characteristics, may simply be family members in a household that shares an Internet connection.\n\nThe merge member feature will attempt to reassign everything attached (in any way) to the 'from' member to the 'to' member.
DOC_LDAP=If you plan to integrate your website into a corporate network, perhaps as your intranet, you may wish to use the same credentials for users of the website as you do for your other services, such as desktop login. With this approach, there are a number of advantages:\n - There is no issue with preventing non-authorised users joining, or having to manually validate accounts of those who do join.\n - Users do not need to join.\n - A user only has a single password to maintain.\n - It is clear who the users of the website are, as there is no potential for them to use unknown handles.\n - Usergroup membership is the same as on your corporate network, and permissions can be assigned using it.\n\nThe standard protocol for sharing of network credentials is called [concept]LDAP[/concept]. Two variations of LDAP are supported:\n - [concept]Active Directory[/concept], which is a standard part of the Windows architecture.\n - [concept]OpenLDAP[/concept], which is the de-facto standard for Linux systems.
DOC_GROUPS=Members exist in a primary usergroup, and may be placed in any number of secondary usergroups. Usergroups serve many purposes, including:\n - demonstrating rank (i.e. a status symbol)\n - grouping members for common permission allocation\n - highlighting involvement\n - incentivising involvement (member contributions to the site and community)
DOC_FORUMS=Discussion forums are a communication tool for site users, based around topics of conversation located within forums.\n\nDiscussion forums are organised into a hierarchical structure (also known as a tree structure). The forum you view when you visit the [concept]discussion forums[/concept] is the [concept]home forum[/concept] in the hierarchy, and contains child forums ([concept]sub-forum[/concept]s), which may themselves contain child forums, and so on. Within each forum there may also be [concept]topic[/concept]s (known as threads in some other software). And within each topic, there are one or more [concept]post[/concept]s.
DOC_EMOTICONS=Emoticons (also known as smilies) are little images used to convey 'emotion' within text. These are an important part of informal communication on the Internet, as body language and tone are not available to (sub-consciously) transmit the same information.\n\nWithout use of emoticons, it can be impossible (unless the writer took great care to express themselves fully) to gauge unwritten details, such as the importance of what is being written, or the writer's emotional perspective on it.
COPPA_MAIL=In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (a U.S. law, but one we follow internationally), your account on {1} is currently inactive.\n\nPlease print this message out and ask if your parent or guardian can sign and date it. Once signed, it should be faxed to:\n\n{2}\n\n\nOR mailed to:\n\n{3}\n\n------------------------------ CUT HERE ------------------------------\n\nPermission to Participate at {1}\n\n{4}\n\nI HAVE REVIEWED THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MY CHILD AND HEREBY GRANT PERMISSION TO {1} TO STORE THIS INFORMATION.\nI UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME BY ENTERING A PASSWORD.\nI UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY REQUEST FOR THIS INFORMATION TO BE REMOVED FROM {1} AT ANY TIME.\nI HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FULL PRIVACY POLICY PUBLISHED AT [url="{5}"]{5}[/url]\n\n\nParent or Guardian\n(print your name here): _____________________\n\n(sign here): __________________ \n\nDate: _______________\n\n------------------------------ CUT HERE ------------------------------\n\n\nOnce a member of staff has received the above form via fax or regular mail your account will be activated.

Just click this link:\n[url="{2}"]{2}[/url]\n\n[font size="0.8"][b]Link not working?[/b] Try this one instead:\n[url="{3}"]{3}[/url]\nYou'll need to enter your e-mail address: {4}, and this code: {5}\n\n[b]Don't remember joining at {1}?[/b] Just disregard this e-mail.[/font]

IP_VERIFY_MAIL=Someone tried to login as you (hopefully you), but your account is secured so as to only allow direct logins from previous IP addresses. You need to confirm this IP address using the link below, but only if {2} was you: [url="{1}"]{1}[/url]\n\nIf this was not triggered by you, there is a serious security breach: apparently, someone knows your password, the 'hash' of your password, or some kind of exploit that allows them to not require your password at all. If this is the case, you need to investigate the IP address that this request came from: if you are a member of staff, you may use the IP address tools from the Admin Zone, which might be able to help you associate a username to the IP address, otherwise you may want to contact the site staff and appraise them of the situation.\n\nIf an error is returned when clicking the link you may try manually entering the confirmation code using the link below:\n[url="{3}"]{3}[/url]\nCode: {4}
