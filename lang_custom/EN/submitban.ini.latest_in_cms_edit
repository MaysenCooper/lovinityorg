IP_BANNING_WILDCARDS=IP address bans restrict access to the website on a low level. Be careful to [url="know an IP address"]{1}[/url] before you ban it to avoid inadvertently banning a shared computer/Internet-gateway. Please also be advised that [abbr="Internet Service Provider"]ISP[/abbr]-assigned addresses are often not fixed: a computer's IP address might vary substantially from one day to the next.\n\nAddresses may contain &lsquo;wildcards&rsquo; (asterisks) between dotted segments to symbolise that any number in that segment will match.\n\nIt is usual to have an asterisk as the final (fourth) part, as a user's IP address is very likely to change in that final component and at the same time it is very unlikely that wildcarding that last portion would result in any unintended bans. This said, extreme care is advised using wildcards at other points.
