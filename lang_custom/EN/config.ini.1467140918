DOC_CONFIGURATION=The configuration module is used to set most website options. The options are spread across multiple option categories, each containing option groups. Each of the options has a description underneath it to help you.\n\nMost configuration options do not need changing unless you want to divert from the default behaviour; the options that do need changing can be configured early-on using the Setup Wizard.
DOC_BASE_CONFIGURATION=To change an option set during installation, you generally use the external "Installation Options editor".\n\nThe Installation Options editor is completely separated from the main software, so that if your site ever breaks due to a misconfiguration in the <kbd>_config.php</kbd> configuration file (perhaps if you moved servers, and your database settings are no longer valid), you can fix it without having to hand-edit the file. As a result of the separation, the Configuration editor cannot empty caches automatically when you change an option, so after using it you should use the cleanup tools to empty the caches.
