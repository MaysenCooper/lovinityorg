DOC_PAGE_MATCH_KEY_ACCESS=If it is not enough to specify whether a member can access a specific page based on the available view permissions and overridden privileges, you can also set things up to deny access to pages based on the URL parameters they are opened with. This could be used, for example, to allow members to browse through download categories but not actually view any download entry.\nThe match-key permission system is not intended to be used unless really needed - it is there to provide additional control when page and privileges won't meet your unique needs.\n\nTo add a new match-key permission, go to the "Match-key page restriction" icon in the Security section of the Admin Zone.\n\nAn example match-key that would deny access for viewing download entries would be: [tt]_WILD:downloads:entry[/tt]. Usergroups could be ticked to deny members in those usergroups access to the website screen that actually views a download ([tt]type=entry[/tt] is that interface).\n\nAt the bottom of the same screen you can choose what error message to display if someone is denied access. This is very useful if you have a specific reason for closing down access to something that you wish to explain.
