DOC_MARKUP=Templates are almost all written in [url="XHTML5"]{$TUTORIAL_URL,tut_markup}[/url] and [url="Tempcode"]{$TUTORIAL_URL,tut_tempcode}[/url], and hence a good knowledge of XHTML5 is required for editing them. This is moderately advanced functionality, not intended for novices - although by all means expand your horizons![staff_note]\n\nIn order to preserve the high web standards Composr is designed for, you can enable the 'webstandards' option in the configuration while conducting testing, to make sure that these standards are not degraded. Of course, this is your choice, and you may choose whatever level of standards support you believe is appropriate to your website.\n\nPlease note that the webstandards checker cannot perform a limited number of some of the markup accessibility checks, so [url="to make an accessible website"]{$TUTORIAL_URL,tut_accessibility}[/url] you must manually make sure you conform to these guidelines:\n - Use a 'noscript' tag wherever appropriate\n - Do not use elements for semantically incorrect uses (such as list tags for non-lists, or the [tt]blockquote[/tt] tag solely for indentation)\n - avoid using animation effects\n - Do not rely on colour as the sole indicator for important information\n - Always provide 'alt' (alternate) content for media, and avoid media where suitable markup alternatives exist[/staff_note]
DOC_CSS=Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) control most visual aspects of your website. Editing CSS files directly is advanced functionality, not intended for novices - although we encourage you to expand your horizons! Novices may wish to use the Theme Wizard to create a customised colour scheme.\n\nIf you want to make an accessible website for those with visual impairements, make sure that you use sufficient contrast between colours. You may wish to use the webstandards checker to check your CSS.\n\nReferences like "[tt]{$GET,area_text}[/tt]" are used by the Theme Wizard to create pleasing colour combinations -- they are associated with equation lines like [tt]{$THEME_WIZARD_COLOR,#325180,area_text,76% seed + 24% WB}[/tt]. If you like you can either edit the colour in the line (you can ignore the equation), or you can replace the reference with a colour directly.\n\n[tt]{$IMG;,example}[/tt] refers to a theme image. You can edit these through the Admin Zone, the easiest way is to just search the Admin Zone for [tt]example[/tt].
