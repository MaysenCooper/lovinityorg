DOC_TRANSLATE=The language editor allows you to translate 'strings' so that your website is displayed in a language other than the original British English. Alternatively, you may just wish to change language strings to change the 'style' of the website.\n\nThe language editor is very easy to use. All you need to do is go to the translation module, choose your language, choose the language file to translate, and then you are presented with an interface to translate the strings.\nA small level of integration is provided for languages which Google can translate, so as to provide a guide.
DOC_FIND_LANG_STRING_TIP=Language file translation is done for two different reasons:\n - to let the website (software) work in languages other than English\n - to customise text away from the default settings.\nFor the case of customisation, the "Language used on this page" feature ("Translate/re-phrase Composr" in the developer tool dropdown in the footer) is perhaps the most appropriate way to make adjustments, as it will lead directly to the strings to be changed.
