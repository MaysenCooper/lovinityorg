KARMA=New User Karma
DESCRIPTION_KARMA=A user's karma is a reflection of their stance in terms of following the rules. Karma can be a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being perfect standing. If this punishment lowers a user's Karma to 0 for first time, consider suspension. Second time and beyond, consider permanent ban. User's Karma rebuilds slowly over time each day they log in to the site. Their current Karma is listed.
BAD_KARMA_RANGE=The user's Karma value can only be between 0 and 100. If this discipline would technically drop the user's karma below 0, set it to 0 and consider suspension (if it's the first time hitting 0) or permanent ban (if second+ time). Discuss with other staff first.
