REPORT_CONTENT=Report Content
DESCRIPTION_REPORT_CONTENT=You are making a report on &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;. You should only report content found to be in violation of our rules, terms, or policies. Otherwise, the auto-hiding feature of the report system may hide content that does not need hiding. <br><br>Please be mindful of what you report. For example, if a specific post is the problem, report the post and not the whole topic. Otherwise, the auto-hiding feature may hide the whole topic. <br><br> If {2} {2|person|people} report the content, it will be hidden automatically until staff review it.<br /><br />Please include your reasoning behind why the content you are reporting is in violation of our rules, terms, or policies. Include screenshots/attachments as necessary. Completion of this report will result in the creation of a support ticket with staff. If you file the report as a guest without an email, or file an anonymous report as a logged in user, be aware that staff will not have communication with you and therefore an inconclusive report will be tossed. <strong>All reports are kept confidential.</strong>
CONFIG_OPTION_reported_times=The number of times content has to be reported for it to be unvalidated.
REPORTED_TIMES=Reports until unvalidation
DESCRIPTION_REPORT_EMAIL=Optionally provide an email address staff can reach you at should they need to follow up with you. If you leave this blank, your anonymity is preserved, but staff cannot follow up with you if more information is needed.
REPORTED_CONTENT=This is an automatically generated support ticket based off of a report against [url="{7}"]{6}[/url][html]<br />[/html]Content creator: {3} [html]<br />[/html]Content Type: {4}[html]<br />[/html]Content ID: {5}[html]<br />[/html]Content: [html]<br /><br />{1}<br /><br />Report information supplied by reporter: <br /><br />[/html]{2}
REPORTED_CONTENT_EXTRA=The reporter has supplied additional information for this report: [html]<br /><br />[/html]{1}
REPORTED_CONTENT_TITLE=Reported content in '{1}'
REPORT_ANONYMOUS=Make report anonymous
DESCRIPTION_REPORT_ANONYMOUS=Report this content as a guest with no email address to conceal your identity. Caution: Doing so means the support ticket created will be made under the system instead of your username. Not only will this mean you will not get Yang for your report, but it also means you will not see the support ticket on your account nor will staff be able to follow up with you if needed.
DUPLICATE_REPORT=<strong>You have already reported this content, and the associated support ticket is still open.</strong> Therefore, instead of creating a new report, you will instead be adding on additional information to the support ticket that is opened.
