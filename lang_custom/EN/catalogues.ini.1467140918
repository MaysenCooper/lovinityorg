DOC_CATALOGUES=The catalogue system is a bit like a visual database system such as Microsoft Access: you create your own &lsquo;record definitions&rsquo; that define what data you want for your records, and then you can add these records, and browse through them. All you need to do is to specify what goes in the records: the rest is all handled for you.\n\nYou can have as many catalogues as you like, and some pre-made ones provided by default.
CATALOGUE_ENTRY_NOTIFICATION_MAIL=A new {4} entry, {2}, has been added to {1}. You can view it from the following URL:\n[url="{3}"]{3}[/url]
