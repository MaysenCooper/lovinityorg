DOC_DOWNLOADS=The download system is a system for the storage, organisation and retrieval of files is provided by Composr -- specifically designed to be an effective tool on sites with very large numbers of downloads. A file in this system is called a download (and by the way, we don't use the noun 'download' to refer to other things in this software).\n\nNote that the download system is not intended for placing articles: there is a dedicated news/articles system for this. You may of course use it to store articles if you prefer to, or to place articles in special formats such as PDF.
DOWNLOAD_NOTIFICATION_MAIL=A new download, {2}, has been added to {1}. You can view it from the following URL:\n[url="{3}"]{3}[/url]
