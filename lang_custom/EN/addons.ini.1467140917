DOC_ADDONS=In order for addons to Composr to be distributed in a user-friendly fashion, an addon pack exporter and importer is provided. Three types of addon are supported by this tool:\n - Language packs (for any new language translation)\n - Themes (for any new theme)\n - Code modifications (defined by manual selection of files)\n\nComposr addons are TAR files which include a special definition file. They may be constructed manually if an author wishes to have more control over the construction process.
