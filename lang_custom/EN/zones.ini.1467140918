DOC_COMCODE_PAGE_EDIT=Use Comcode pages to build your own raw website pages. You have full control over the layout of Comcode pages, but with the power to use any Comcode tags you wish.\n\nPages are placed within zones, and can be organised into a tree structure.
DOC_ZONES=Zones are Composr's method for supporting sub-sites. The website directory structure could be heavily simplified from the user's point of view, to be as follows:\n - (root directory)\n  - [tt]adminzone[/tt]\n  - [tt]forum[/tt]\n  - [tt]cms[/tt]\n  - [tt]site[/tt]\nEach entry in this list, including the root directory, is a 'zone'. A zone groups pages into URL-segregated directories, and can be individually configured. New zones may be added, existing zones deleted, and pages created in and moved between zones.
DOC_ZONE_EDITOR=The [concept]Zone Editor[/concept] is a user-friendly editor to edit details for a zone, and all panels within the zone, simultaneously. It has the ability to preview changes easily, without having to switch between the Admin Zone and the zone being edited.\n\nThe Zone Editor makes use of special tabs to fit everything together, with each panel/page getting its own tab-set. The tabs provided are: view, edit, details, and settings (except for the panels).
