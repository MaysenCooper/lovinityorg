[semihtml][title]2A. Introduction to staff training / Syllabus[/title]

<h2>Introduction to training</h2>
Congratulations on being chosen to participate in a group of staff with the aim to make The Lovinity Community+ a warm, welcoming, safe community for all. Before you become an official staff member, however, you will be going through a training process. This training process is essential to ensure that you are educated on what we expect of you and what you can expect of us. The training process will also incorporate a period of monitored work in which you will prove your skills to us before a final decision about whether or not to officially bring you on board is made.<br />
<br />
Training time will vary depending on an individual&#39;s needs. It is estimated for most people that training will take 3 weeks. During these couple of weeks, official staff will be woking closely with you to help you understand our policies, procedures, and expectations. You will be reading several documents about our policies, taking a few quizzes and completing some exercises, and doing some &quot;field work&quot; under the supervision of another staff member. It is very important that you cooperate throughout the training process to ensure you understand how staff work, and so you are productive in the long run.
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
After completing the Lovinity Community+ Staff training, you will be able to do the following (this is a non-comprehensive list):

<ul>
	<li>You will have a strong understanding of our policies, including but not limited to the Non-Disclosure agreement, rules, Terms of Service, Privacy policy, Safe Space policy, and any additional policies.

	<li>You will know what to do in certain conflicts.</li>
	<li>You will know how to use the Composr CMS website software and administration controls.</li>
	<li>You will be familiar with your duties and expectations.</li>

<h2>Requirements for Training</h2>
During the training process, you will be expected to adhere to the following in order to ensure a productive and beneficial training for you:

<ul>
	<li>You will need to dedicate at least 10&nbsp;hours per week for training during your training process; we do not tolerate trainees who decide to rarely show up for training.</li>
	<li>You will need to log in to your Lovinity Community+ account on a near regular basis to check for messages and correspondance from other staff, and reply to any messages promptly.</li>
	<li>During training, a Skype account is mandatory. Some of the training is conducted via. screen casting in order to show you how to use certain features on our website software. After training is complete, you do not need Skype anymore as most staff correspondance is to be done via. the staff forums (and meetings will be held via. chat rooms).</li>
	<li>You will need to be cooperative with the training process; complete your tasks, read the materials, take the quizzes, and act professionally with the staff who is supervising your training.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask questions!&nbsp;</strong>There is no such thing as a stupid question. If you&#39;re unsure of something, even if just a little unsure, ask questions. We would rather repeat ourselves in order to ensure you understand our procedures and policies than for you to go in blindly.</li>
	<li>If you bring forth any personal turmoil, anger, bias, etc. with you regarding the community or other staff, you will be expected to have put those differences aside by no later than the beginning of week 2 of your training. If you have any problems with any staff, they do not belong here... unless the problems deal with how they are doing their job on staff, in which case you are to contact an admin privately.</li>
	<li>Be aware that you are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;an official staff member until after you have successfully completed and passed your training. Please do not show yourself off as being a staff if you have not completed the training. You may, however, say you&#39;re a staff in training. But no trainee is guaranteed to get an official staff position; you must pass the training.</li>
</ul>
