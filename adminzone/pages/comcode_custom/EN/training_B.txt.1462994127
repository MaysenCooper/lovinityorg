[semihtml][title]2B. Staff Chain of Command / Staff Positions[/title]

<h2>Chain of Command</h2>
The Lovinity Community+ staff chain of command is split into 5 main powers, each with their own set duties and responsibilities. Despite this chain of command, all staff are expected to work together as a team. However, staff with more experience are usually given a higher power. This does not mean they are better than those below them on the chain. It simply means they have more responsibilities. It is expected of all staff to treat each other with respect regardless of where they sit on the chain of command. However, you are more than free to dispute an issue with a staff member privately with an administrator.<br />
<br />
In this guide, we will discuss the chain of command in order from top to bottom.
<h3>High-level Administrators</h3>
High level administrators are your CEOs and vice CEOs. They have responsibilities and power around the entire website. They make the final decision for big decisions and have the power to overrule decisions made by staff in lower chain of commands. They help out across all teams and ensure server and software payments are paid and legal matters, if they come up, are taken care of. They also have the power to hire and fire other staff.

<h3>Low-level administrators / Advisers</h3>
Low level administrators, also called advisers, are trained professionals who assist the high level administrators in certain areas of the website. Though they have some of the same powers as high-level administrators, they do not make final decisions nor hire and fire other staff. They are mainly around to provide assistance and a check on power when, and only when, needed by other staff. Unlike most other staff, advisers are professionally trained in fields such as psychology, sociology, LGBTQA affairs, interdisciplinary studies, activism, and so on.

<h3>Team Leaders</h3>
Team leaders are in charge of everyone within their position. They ensure everyone within a team are working together and working productively. They have the final say-so in decisions relating to their team, though an administrator can over-rule it. They also have a say-so in hiring and firing procedures for staff related to the team they lead, although the administrators make the final decision.<br />
<br />
Currently, we do not use Team leaders as our staff force is too small. All teams are lead by administrators.
<h3>Staff Members</h3>
Official staff members are those who have passed trials and are actively carrying out some of the main duties of the staff team. They are the worker bees of the website. And although they are not that high in the chain of command, they are one of the most essential groups of people in the staff system.

<h3>Trainees</h3>
Trainees are those who have yet to pass the training and trials. They are not recognized by The Lovinity Community+ as official staff yet, and therefore do not carry out the duties and responsibilities of other staff. Their focus is to learn and be trained.<br />
