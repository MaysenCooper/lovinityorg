[semihtml][title]2A. Introduction to staff training / Syllabus[/title]

<h2>Introduction to training</h2>
Congratulations on being chosen to participate in a group of staff with the aim to make The Lovinity Community+ a warm, welcoming, safe community for all. Before you become an official staff member, however, you will be going through a training process. This training process is essential to ensure that you are educated on what we expect of you and what you can expect of us. The training process will also incorporate a period of monitored work in which you will prove your skills to us before a final decision about whether or not to officially bring you on board is made.<br />
<br />
Training time will vary depending on an individual&#39;s needs. It is estimated for most people that training will take 3 weeks. During these couple of weeks, official staff will be woking closely with you to help you understand our policies, procedures, and expectations. You will be reading several documents about our policies, taking a few quizzes and completing some exercises, and doing some &quot;field work&quot; under the supervision of another staff member. It is very important that you cooperate throughout the training process to ensure you understand how staff work, and so you are productive in the long run.
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>You will have a strong understanding of our policies, including but not limited to the Non-Disclosure agreement, rules, Terms of Service, Privacy policy, Safe Space policy, and any additional policies.

<h2>Requirements for Training</h2>
During the training process, you will be expected to adhere to the following in order to ensure a productive and beneficial training for you:

<ul>
	<li>You will need to dedicate at least 10&nbsp;hours per week for training during your training process; we do not tolerate trainees who decide to rarely show up for training.</li>
	<li>You will need to log in to your Lovinity Community+ account on a near regular basis to check for messages and correspondance from other staff, and reply to any messages promptly.</li>
	<li>During training, a Skype account is mandatory. Some of the training is conducted via. screen casting in order to show you how to use certain features on our website software. After training is complete, you do not need Skype anymore as most staff correspondance is to be done via. the staff forums (and meetings will be held via. chat rooms).</li>
	<li>You will need to be cooperative with the training process; complete your tasks, read the materials, take the quizzes, and act professionally with the staff who is supervising your training.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask questions!&nbsp;</strong>There is no such thing as a stupid question. If you&#39;re unsure of something, even if just a little unsure, ask questions. We would rather repeat ourselves in order to ensure you understand our procedures and policies than for you to go in blindly.</li>
	<li>If you bring forth any personal turmoil, anger, bias, etc. with you regarding the community or other staff, you will be expected to have put those differences aside by no later than the beginning of week 2 of your training. If you have any problems with any staff, they do not belong here&hellip; unless the problems deal with how they are doing their job on staff, in which case you are to contact an admin privately.</li>
	<li>Be aware that you are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;an official staff member until after you have successfully completed and passed your training. Please do not show yourself off as being a staff if you have not completed the training. You may, however, say you&#39;re a staff in training. But no trainee is guaranteed to get an official staff position; you must pass the training.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Pass / Fail trials</h2>
After you complete week 3 / field work of training, you will be put on hold for up to a couple days while staff collaborate about your performance during training. During this time, we will be making a decision about whether or not to bring you on board as an official staff. Determining factors include but are not limited to scores on quizzes, how you conducted yourself during the training, how well you have learned what is required to know as staff, how well you did during the field work stage, and so on. Once a decision is made, you will be informed and then further steps will be mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you fail your training, you will not become an official staff member. However, you may try the training again in 30 days, providing nothing seriously concerning happened during your training (such as poor behavior or a violation of the NDA), and also providing the position is still open.<br />
<br />
If you pass, you will become an official staff member and will e informed on your next steps and what will happen next. You will be given an official welcome to the team and will be joining a group of enthusiastic friendly individuals to make a safe and fun social community.<br />
