[semihtml]<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;1&quot;]Guide[/title]</kbd> This guide serves administrators a guide for moderating and executing disciplinary actions on members. <b>This is only a guide.</b> If you feel the need to do something different, by all means do so. If you think this guide needs revised, please contact Lovinity.<br />
<br />
[contents][/contents] &nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]General Statement[/title]</kbd> As a moderator or administrator, one of your duties is to moderate the content of The Lovinity Community+ for any behavior or content that could pose a threat to others or the website. It is vital to understand that the way you communicate to users when moderating content should not be that which is harsh, strict, or mean. You should maintain a professional &quot;customer service&quot; behavior and attitude when speaking with other users about matters regarding moderation and the rules. Be sure to listen to the other user as well and be open-minded about any disputes he/she may have.<br />
<br />
It is vital to read and understand the rules to a great capacity in order to effectively moderate. The rules can be located by <a class="user_link" href="http://lovinity.org/pg/rules" rel="" target="_top">Clicking This Link.</a><br />
<br />
It is also very important to routinely check the support tickets for any rule violating content that has been reported by the community as well as ban appeals. On the admin home page, the Checklist block will let you know when there are any support tickets that are in need of review. Be sure to take care of these promptly and accurately.<br />
<br />
<b>IMPORTANT: Do not punish other staff members! If a staff member violates a rule, please bring it to the attention of Lovinity for review.</b> &nbsp;<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Taking care of reported items[/title]</kbd> Part of your job as a moderator is to deal with reported content. Reported content will appear as Support tickets in the Lovinity Community. The number of open support tickets (total), if any, will be displayed in the checklist on the admin control panel front page. Clicking the link will take you to the support tickets.<br />
<br />
There is a specific procedure to handling reported content.&nbsp;The procedure for handling reports is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t handle a report that someone else has already been assigned to, unless they later indicate they are opening it back up for someone else to handle.</li>
	<li>Read an unhandled report in its entirety and make sure you understand everything going on in the report. Then, make a <b>regular (non-staff) reply</b>&nbsp;to the support ticket indicating that you are handling it. This is so that other staff know not to touch it, and so the user who filed the report knows a staff is now handling it. In addition,&nbsp;<strong>assign</strong>&nbsp;yourself to the ticket (see the top of the ticket).</li>
	<li>If you need to do things or get more information about a report before you can continue, be sure to do so ASAP (use the support ticket and make a <b>regular (non-staff) reply</b>&nbsp;if you have any questions or need more info from the user who filed the report). If you cannot do it right away, then make an item in the admin frontpage checklist stating &quot;(username): (task)&quot; and don&#39;t set any recurrance.</li>
	<li>Put all relevant information to a report inside the report support ticket as a <b>staff-only reply</b>&nbsp;to it. This is important for record keeping, especially if the user later decides to appeal your discipline.</li>
	<li>Once you have decided an appropriate action, make a <b>staff-only reply</b>&nbsp;to the support ticket explaining what you did and why. Include everything (such as edits you made to posts, discipline you issued and to whom, a copy of the message you sent to the user, etc.)</li>
	<li>Then, make another&nbsp;<b>regular (non-staff-only) reply</b>&nbsp;to the support ticket explaining to the user who filed the report that the report has been handled by staff. Please do not include private information , such as what disciplinary measure you took.in a public reply to the user, such as disciplinary actions taken. That stuff should be a separate staff-only reply.</li>
	<li>After all replies are made and the case is finished, scroll down and find the close button to close the support ticket.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;1&quot;]Discipline[/title]</kbd><kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Important notes: Moderating content[/title]</kbd> When moderating content on the website, especially when it comes to the forums, please be aware of the following:

<ul>
	<li>Do&nbsp;<b>NOT</b>&nbsp;delete comments, replies, etc. Instead, if you have to censor content from a comment or reply, use the edit functionality as described in the &quot;Editing Comments / Forum Posts&quot; section. That way, a record can be kept of the original post, necessary for when users appeal moderator decisions.

	<ul>
		<li>If a forum topic is so out of hand you need to prevent others from communicating on it, lock the topic and move it to the &quot;archives&quot; forum; don&#39;t delete it.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Do&nbsp;<b>NOT</b>&nbsp;delete content, such as downloads, pictures and media, form submissions, etc. until after the 72-hour appeal time period is up, and only if the user did not file an appeal in that time frame and if you no longer need the content for other purposes (such as law enforcement). Instead, invalidate the content so that it&#39;s not visible to the public. Exceptions to this rule may be stated in the guide.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]How to: Punish a user[/title]</kbd>There are two ways to issue disciplinary sanctions to a user. It depends on what you are punishing the user for which way you use.

<ul>
	<li>If you are punishing a user for something they said in the forums, in a comment, in a private topic, or anywhere where a &quot;punish&quot; button is available below, click the &quot;punish&quot; button.</li>
	<li>If you are punishing a user for content they submitted, such as downloads, media, form entries, anything where a punish button is not available below the content, then go to the user&#39;s profile page. On the bottom right, click the arrow next to &quot;Audit&quot; to open its menu. And then click &quot;warn/punish member&quot;.</li>
	<li>Review the case again, and also review the punishment and warning history of the user you&#39;re about to punish before punishing him/her . You want to make sure the user wasn&#39;t already spoken to about this issue, or you may decide to elevate the severity of your punishment if the user had violated the same rule in the past. <b>Also make note of the current user&#39;s karma.</b></li>
	<li>If overall violation is first-time and trivial, simply message the user asking them not to do it again (don&#39;t use warn/punish system, just send them a whisper or private topic). Otherwise, proceed with issuing a&nbsp;<strong>warrant </strong>(unless the violation was very severe, in which case prosecute immediately.</li>
	<li>To issue a warrant, you&#39;d use the punish button or warn/punish member link accordingly. Fill in the fields as appropriate (do not check the prosecution box).&nbsp;<strong>Only issue preventive discipline for a warrant if necessary.&nbsp;</strong>For example, if a user was spamming, you may want to issue 3 days probation or silence them from the specific topic/forum they were causing an issue in. Point fines, karma reductions, suspensions, and bans should not be issued with a warrant.</li>
	<li>Once the warrant is issued, check back in 72 hours to see if the user provided a defense statement. If so, use that statement to decide what appropriate discipline to issue (point fines, karma restrictions, suspensions, bans, probation, etc.). Re-read the case and the evidence. Then, if discipline is necessary, issue a&nbsp;<strong>prosecution</strong>&nbsp;the same way (click punish button or warn/punish member link, but make sure you check the box indicating it&#39;s a prosecution).</li>
	<li>Once you&#39;ve decided how to punish the user, fill out the punishment form as described below:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Is a prosecution:</b>&nbsp;Check this box if you are issuing a prosecution, that-is a final decision on what discipline to issue to the user (usually following 3 days after a warrant).</li>
		<li><b>Silence from the topic</b>&nbsp;(only available if you used a punish button): If you wish to prevent the user from being able to reply anymore to the topic they violated the rules in, set a date and time for when their silence expires. Otherwise, leave this blank.</li>
		<li><b>Silence from the forum</b>&nbsp;(only available if you used a punish button): If you want to prevent the user from being able to reply to any topics in the forum, or create any new topics in that forum they violated the rules in, set a date and time their silence is to expire. Otherwise, leave blank.</li>
		<li><b>Set Probation:</b>&nbsp;Here, specify the number of days to put the member in probation. If the member is already in probation, this number of days is added on. Leave at 0 to not issue [additional] probation. Keep reading to learn about what probation is.</li>
		<li><b>Ban the member&#39;s IP address:</b>&nbsp;Checking this box will ban their IP. This completely prohibits their ability to access lovinity.org from their last-known IP. The system will assume you are issuing a permanent ban if you check this box. Be sure to ban the member too if you ban an IP.</li>
		<li><b>Syndicate to Stop Forum Spam (and beyond):</b>&nbsp;Checking this box will report the user to online spam databases. When added to a spam database, many websites that perform spam checks will notice the user in the database, thereby preventing them from registering. You should ONLY report a user to Stop Forum Spam if you are SURE that they are a spammer or a troll.</li>
		<li><b>Charge points:</b>&nbsp;Insert the number of points to charge the user for their discipline. This guide will give you ideas on how much to charge, but ultimately it&#39;s at your discretion. You should not charge points for informal warnings, but you should charge points if the user will be earning a strike.</li>
		<li><strong>Change Karma:&nbsp;</strong>The current user&#39;s karma level (0 to 100) is displayed in the box. Change it to the karma level they should be at after this discipline, if applicable.</li>
		<li><b>Ban member:</b>&nbsp;Use this to ban (or in our definition, suspend) the member. Unlike banning their IP, this prevents them from logging in, but they can still use lovinity.org as a guest user.</li>
		<li><b>Change usergroup to:</b>&nbsp;Move the user to a different usergroup. Typically this should not be needed unless an admin is demoting a staff member as a result of their violation.</li>
		<li><b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;This is a short line of text explaining what the violation is. This is what appears in records. For explanation, you should write something like &quot;Section 0.0 (violation)&quot;, where section is the section / rule number they violated according to the rules page, and violation is a brief description of their violation. If they violated multiple sections, then put something like &quot;Section 0.0; 0.1; 0.2 (blah; blah blah; more blah)&quot;</li>
		<li><b>Violating Content:&nbsp;</b>Explain here what exactly the user posted or did that was found to be in violation of the rules.</li>
		<li><strong>Violating Rule(s):&nbsp;</strong>Explain here which rules the user violated.</li>
		<li><strong>Additional Discipline:&nbsp;</strong>If you did something in addition to any of the Punitive actions (you do not need to mention what you set for punitive actions; that will automatically be included in the message), such as censored or &quot;removed&quot; content, explain so here in a bullet point list.</li>
		<li><strong>Discipline Appeal?: </strong>Check this box if the user is allowed to appeal the discipline within 72 hours. Typically you would check this box unless this guide says otherwise. Checking this box will provide appeal instructions automatically to the user.</li>
		<li><strong>Further Actions / Defense statement requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Here, include any additional steps or actions (besides re-reading the rules; that&#39;s already included) the user should take. For warrants, if you have special requirements, such as specific info the user needs to include, also put that here.</li>
		<li><span style=" color: #FF0000; "><b>Don&#39;t ever use save explanatory details;</b>&nbsp;the system is faulty. If you want to use your own templates, save them at your own risk somewhere on your computer.</span></li>

<br style="orphans: 1" />
<span style="orphans: 1">First off, if the disciplinary action requires the hiding of content, such as forum posts and comments, to staff only. place a staff_note comcode around the content that is to be hidden (example, removing the asterisks: [*staff_note*]Offending content[*/staff_note*] ) . If it&#39;s only to be hidden for a time, usually 72 hours to allow appeal, then make a note in the notes box on the admin dashboard indicating to remove hidden content at (insert date) if user does not appeal. Then paste a link to the post (On the forum, to the top right of a post, you&#39;ll see a number. This is the post number. Right-click it and copy link address. Then paste it in your note. If it&#39;s a comment, at the bottom you&#39;ll see a small long box with a gear icon that has a link to take you to comment thread. You may have to click the linear button to see the post numbers.).</span><br style="orphans: 1" />
<br style="orphans: 1" />
<span style="orphans: 1">If you edit or hide content from any social posts or comments, please do not fully delete them. Instead, edit them and put &quot;[Content was in violation of the rules and was removed by staff]&quot; in place of the content you remove (or under the content you hid). The only exception is if you have to remove many comments or posts in the same thread by the same user. But in that case you should consider locking the topic instead.</span><br />

If a section is not available, then likely it is not a rule that can be violated per-se. If I made a mistake, let Lovinity know.<br />
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]The guide[/title]</kbd>Here is the guide:<br />
<br />
<b>Note: You should allow 72 hours to appeal any disciplinary actions before permanently removing content, unless otherwise noted.<br />
<br />
Note 2: These guides do not provide discipline suggestions based on offense number, only offense severity.</b> I feel that the fact a certain amount of strikes can earn you extra punishment is good enough with covering violation numbers. However, if you feel the user needs a harder push because they&#39;ve had problems with this or other rules in the past, don&#39;t hesitate to consider a higher level of punishment. But remember the goal: Our goal is not to attack users for their wrongdoings&hellip; our goal is to educate and help them while keeping everyone else safe.<br />

[hide param="4.5 (Registering multiple accounts)"]When to discipline: Whenever you know for sure there are multiple accounts by the same person (usually, but not always, indicated by accounts registered on the same IP, by the same/similar email, etc.)<br />
<br />
Why this rule: There are several reasons. If we allowed multiple accounts, people can take advantage of that in terms of moderation. In addition, points and other things should all be kept central on one account for the person, or it becomes disorganized.

The letter must demonstrate that you are truly sorry for what you&#39;ve done, that you understand fully what you&#39;ve done, what you&#39;ve learned from your suspension, how you&#39;ll behave differently when let back on site, and that you will not do it again. The letter will be reviewed by staff and will determine if you&#39;re ready to have your suspension lifted. If you&#39;re not ready, the suspension will be extended, but you can try appealing it again after the time expires. If you are ready, you&#39;ll be allowed back on site with 30-day probation. During the 30-day probation period, all content you submit must be approved by staff before it is displayed.</span><br />
