[semihtml][title]3B. Human Sexuality[/title]
Because the Lovinity Community+ is a big supporter of the LGBT community, and because supporting the LGBT community is essential to making a safe space environment, it is important to understand human sexuality. You may try to dismiss this section if you have previously taken a course in sexuality. However, this is a different kind of sexuality; identities in society. It is vital that you and all staff understand sexual identities in order to promote a safe environment for The Lovinity Community+.

<h2>Terms</h2>
Let&#39;s first off start with&nbsp;<strong>sex.</strong>&nbsp;If you are very unfamiliar with social terms, you might be a part of many people who think sex is the identity of all. But it&#39;s not. Sex solely represents biology. It is the reproductive system that a person has. Please be aware that &quot;sex&quot; should not be used alone as it is ambiguous. Use the term &quot;Sex assigned at birth&quot;.&nbsp;<strong>It is also important to realize that it is discriminatory to identify someone based on sex; identify based on their gender identity instead.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Gender identity</strong>&nbsp;is the term used to describe how someone identifies in their mind. It is very important to realize that gender is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;binary. There is more than just &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;. In fact, gender is most easily represented using a spectrum:

Notice in this graph that the X axis represents the degree of intensity for female characteristics... and the Y axis represents the degree of intensity for male characteristics. There is an entire quadrant in which people may place in terms of their gender identity. Some individuals may also choose not to be identified by anything at all. There are many ways to represent the gender spectrum; this is just one. Some use symbols, some use rainbow colors, some use venn diagrams and circles.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sexual orientation&nbsp;</strong>is the term used for who you are attracted to. However, this does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;always define how you actually behave sexually in society. For example, a bisexual individual may still choose to behave as a heterosexual individual in society.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sexual behavior&nbsp;</strong>is how you behave sexually in society.<br />
<br />
<strong>Gender role&nbsp;</strong>is the pre-determined set of behaviors and actions by society that an individual chooses to express. Someone who gender-identifies as male may still wish to stay within a mostly-female social gender role, liking and participating in activities that mainly appeal to women (according to society, mind you).&nbsp;<br />
