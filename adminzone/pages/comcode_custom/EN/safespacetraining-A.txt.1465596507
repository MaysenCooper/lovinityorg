[semihtml][title]3A. Safe Space Training Introduction[/title]
By now, you probably wondered what all the hype is about in terms of our website being a &quot;Safe Space&quot;. Now is the time that you&#39;ll learn about our Safe Space policies and what you need to know to make our website a Safe Space. All staff members are expected to follow these guidelines very faithfully in our community. We want everyone to feel like they&#39;re welcomed and a part of a safe environment.

<h2>What is a Safe Space?</h2>
The term &quot;Safe Space&quot; is frequently used in businesses, schools and universities, and on social media. The term &quot;safe space&quot; is an identification to tell other people that the business, school/university, website, or entity promotes and encourages an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Safe Spaces are meant to encourage freedom of thought, expression, and dialogue without the fear of being made uncomfortable, unwelcome, or discriminated against. This is regardless of how one identifies; everyone is welcome. In addition, should a problem arise, safe spaces aim to promote an environment of safety, support, non-bias, dialogue, listening, and collaboration to resolve the conflict at hand. Some Safe spaces, including ours on The Lovinity Community+, also work to protect confidentiality and privacy. Anything shared within a safe space is to stay within the confines of that safe space.<br />
