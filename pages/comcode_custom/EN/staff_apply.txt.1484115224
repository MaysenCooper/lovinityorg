<strong>This page is still incomplete. When complete, this message will be removed. Therefore please do not assume the requirements listed here are what is going to happen.</strong><br />
<br />
If you would like to volunteer time to helping to run The Lovinity Community+, you may do so by becoming a part of our staff team. Together as staff, our goal is to ensure the smooth and safe operations of the website, and to promote and expand when needed.<br />
<br />
Since we are a non-profit, positions are not paid. However, your experience as a staff member could be mentioned on your resume for future jobs. Although the positions are not paid, you will be rewarded in other ways, such as additional Yang and praise, for your contributions.
<h2>Duties</h2>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>All staff</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All staff will be required to go through safe space training. Safe space training educates people on LGBT affairs as well as what to do in different situations, such as when one makes a mistake or an assumption.</li>
	<li>All staff will also be required to go through TLC+ specific staff training. In this training, you will learn what is expected of you, what you can expect from us, how to perform your duties, and what to do in certain situations.</li>
	<li>All staff must be fluid in the English language. Developers&nbsp;are an exception since they work behind the scenes, but should still be able to speak some English.</li>
	<li>For legal liability reasons, all staff must be 18 years old or over. You will be asked to prove your age during the application process (by providing government-issued ID or birth certificate).</li>
	<li>If you have ever reached 100 demerits against your account (been suspended or banned), unfortunately you won&#39;t be allowed to be staff on The Lovinity Community+.</li>
	<li>All staff must be actively engaged on the website and attend to their duties. They must also notify Lovinity in the event of a prolonged absence of 4&nbsp;or more consecutive days.</li>
	<li>All staff are expected to name and claim any and all mistakes they make without making excuses.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Solidarity Mode</h4>
When a major tragedy occurs in the world, Lovinity will sometimes declare Solidarity Mode on The Lovinity Community+. When solidarity mode is declared, staff are required to spend at minimum 8 hours each day during solidarity mode on the website. That way, users can turn to a staff for comfort or grievance. Any staff who cannot make this commitment must report to Lovinity within 16 hours of solidarity mode being declared with a good justifiable reason why they cannot make the commitment. Any staff who fail to make the commitment and fail to provide good reasoning as to why they couldn&#39;t could be suspended from their position for a length of time determined by Lovinity.<br />
<br />
Solidarity mode is only declared for tragedies in which multiple countries are mourning from, and usually only lasts 1-3 days when declared.
