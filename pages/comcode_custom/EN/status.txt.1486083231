			<td>We&#39;re testing new code that allows the bot to display what is playing on radio.lovinity.org as the Discord game status of the bot. A few issues are to be expected, such as the bot not auto-recovering from disconnection. We hope new code put into the bot has fixed this, though.</td>

			<td><s>The computer housing the radio system and Discord bot is experiencing major instability and is freezing on average 3 times per day. The TLC+ radio system has been shut down until the computer maintains good stability.&nbsp;</s>&nbsp;We moved the radio system to a separate hard drive so the computer&#39;s resources could be spread across two hard drives. This seems to have resulted in significant stability improvements.</td>
