The Lovinity Community+ is a safe space website.

All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been safe-space trained in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
Due to popular demand by the members of our community, we have disabled word filtering on the website in order to promote freedom of speech and expression. However, with lack of censorship also comes responsibility. Despite our lack of automatic word filtering, The Lovinity Community+ still enforces this inclusive language policy. The purpose of this policy is to promote an inclusive environment for everyone as well as minimize the use of derogatory and hate speech. You are expected to adhere to these policies in all communication that takes place on our website. Staff may issue discipline if you frequently violate this policy, or if other members complain about your poor choice of language.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our inclusive language policy is especially open to feedback as making a safe space is a community effort.&nbsp;</strong>If you disagree with certain aspects of our policy, please email support@lovinity.org or file a support ticket under about -&gt; support tickets . If multiple people have the same concerns, we&#39;ll consider revising the policy.

<h3>Terms that should be avoided</h3>
The following terms should be avoided in our community as they are either highly insulting or are non-inclusive. Recommendations for what to use instead are included.

<ul>
	<li>Do not use: older person/people, elder, senior citizen<br />
	Use: Person/people of advanced age<br />
	Why?: The emphasis is on the person and not their age</li>
	<li>Do not use: poor person/people, poverty-stricken person/people, ghetto, welfare king/queen<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of low economic status<br />
	Why: the statement places emphasis on person/people, not on their economic status. In addition, some people may choose to live in low economic status because of their beliefs, which does not make them &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;poverty-stricken&quot;.</li>
	<li>Do not use: homeless person/people<br />
	Use: person/people experiencing homelessness<br />
	Why:&nbsp;it identifies person, not their state of home.</li>
	<li>Do not use: rich person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of high economic status<br />
	Why:&nbsp;it identifies person, not the fact they are rich. The term rich people/person also implies one cannot be wealthy in other ways.</li>
	<li>Do not use: overweight people/person, obese people/person, fat person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of size<br />
	Why: overweight and obese have different standards depending on culture and are medical terms that should not be used to define someone. Fat is a derogatory term.</li>
	<li>Do not use: Skinny/anorexic&nbsp;person/people, sick person/people (when referring to weight)<br />
	Use: Person/people of small size<br />
	Why: Emphasis is on person and not their size. Also, anorexia is a medical disorder and should not be used to identify someone. Also, sick defines that the person should not be that small, which is not always the case.</li>
	<li>When stating someone&#39;s disability, do not use: suffers from, stricken with, afflicted with<br />
	Use: lives with<br />
	Why:&nbsp;these terms put a negative light on disabilities and illnesses.</li>
	<li>Do not use: able-bodied person/people, whole person/people, normal person/people<br />
	Use: person/people with no disabilities<br />
	Why: Able-bodied implies those with a disability cannot perform regular tasks, which is not always true.&nbsp;The term whole and &quot;normal&quot; casts the stigma that it&#39;s not okay to be disabled.</li>
	<li>Do not use:&nbsp;handicapped, challenged person/people, physically/emotionally/mentally challenged/disturbed, crip, cripple<br />
	Use: person/people with a disability<br />
	Why: The terms above either put emphasis on disability rather than the individual, or they are derogatory and discriminate against people with disabilities.</li>
	<li>Do not use: blind person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people who is/are visually impaired</li>
	<li>Do not use: deaf person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people who is/are hard of hearing</li>
	<li>Do not use: speech impediment<br />
	Use:&nbsp;speech impairment<br />
	Why:&nbsp;Impediment is not an accurate term to use.</li>

	Use: person/people with a speech impairment</li>
	<li>Do not use: little person/people, dwarf, midget<br />

	Use: Person/people with a developmental/learning disability<br />
	Why: Above terms are derogatory and insulting</li>
	<li>Do not use: colored/dark person/people,&nbsp;negro, nigger, nigga<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of color<br />
	Why: first term&nbsp;places emphasis on people and not the color of their skin. The &quot;N words&quot; are all discriminatory and should never be used, especially given their history.&nbsp;<strong>Use of any of the three N words will result in no-questions-asked discipline.</strong></li>
	<li>Do not use: caucasian person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of no color</li>

	Why: It is a highly offensive word and discriminatory against women</li>
	<li>Do not use: Various terms that gender occupational roles in society and jobs<br />

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). Not doing so can result in intervention. We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).<br />
<br />
These language policies may change at any time without notice as language constantly changes.<br />
