In an effort to keep our community safe, while at the same time promoting open discussion of controversial and sensitive topics, The Lovinity Community+ is both a&nbsp;<strong>safe space&nbsp;</strong>and a&nbsp;<strong>brave space.</strong>&nbsp;

<h2>Safe Space</h2>
The Lovinity Community+ aims to help others feel safe and able to discuss sensitive and important matters without fear of blatant harassment, bullying, nor discrimination. To meet this goal, we have the following Safe Space policies in place:

<ul>
	<li>People of all races, ethnicities, sexes, gender identities, sexual orientations, ranges of abilities, ages*, social economic classes, religions, cultures, political stances, nationalities, and so on may <strong>use our website without being discriminated</strong>.

	<ul>
		<li>*Individuals under 13 years of age must get parental consent to use our website as per the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We&nbsp;<strong>prohibit&nbsp;discrimination of others</strong>&nbsp;in our community, including micro-aggressions. Discussion of discrimination, however, is permitted and encouraged.</li>
	<li><b>Harassment and bullying is prohibited</b>&nbsp;in our community as well. We value the safety and security of our members. Discussions about harassment/bullying are welcome and encouraged, though.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for discrimination nor harassment/bullying here,&nbsp;even if it&#39;s religiously influenced.</li>
	<li>If you find yourself harassing, bullying, or discriminating others&hellip; intentionally or not&hellip; you are asked to&nbsp;<strong>name it and claim it.&nbsp;</strong>Admit you have made a mistake and correct yourself.&nbsp;<strong>Do not make excuses nor argue.&nbsp;</strong>Remember, intent does not matter; impact does.</li>
	<li>We require&nbsp;<strong>trigger and NSFW warnings</strong>&nbsp;on applicable content on our website. That way, those who may be bothered by such content can then make a personal conscious decision whether or not to proceed with viewing the content.</li>
	<li>We have privacy settings in place on some areas of our website, such as the forum, to discourage leaking of potentially sensitive and personal info about others. In order to preserve the integrity of our privacy values, we&nbsp;<strong>strictly prohibit direct copy/pasting of any website content.</strong>&nbsp;If you wish to share something with others, please share the link to the content, not the actual content.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Safety cannot be guaranteed.</strong>&nbsp;Please be aware that although The Lovinity Community+ promotes a safe environment for everyone, safety cannot be guaranteed for anyone. There may be times you will experience discrimination, bullying, and harassment in our community. It is important you recognize this and challenge it when it happens (challenging is not the same as retaliating; it&#39;s acknowledging that it is happening and that you stand against it. Challenging may also include refuting discrimination, bullying, or harassment, with research and evidence.)&nbsp;<strong>You should also expect to come across uncomfortable topics in our community</strong>, and we ask that you approach these topics respectfully. We do not, and will not, try to censor sensitive topics. In fact, we encourage them as they help others confront important issues.

<h2>Brave Space</h2>
The Lovinity Community+ also encourages others in our community to discuss matters which may be sensitive or controversial in nature. It&#39;s the only way we can learn from each other about important social matters, and to dismantle systems of oppression, discrimination, bullying, and harassment. Therefore, we have the following Brave Space guidelines in place:

<ul>
	<li>When someone presents a story, experience, or position on a matter, we ask that others&nbsp;<strong>listen to them.&nbsp;</strong>We do not take kindly to closed-mindedness and selective listening&nbsp;in this community. You don&#39;t have to agree with someone to listen to them. But it is important you at least take other people&#39;s thoughts and experiences into consideration.</li>
	<li>We&nbsp;<strong>encourage the sharing of stories, experiences, and thoughts</strong>, no matter how controversial or sensitive they may be. Open discussion is critical to understanding each other and dismantling oppression, discrimination, harassment, and bullying.</li>
	<li>We&nbsp;<strong>expect our members to take accountability.</strong>&nbsp;If you make a mistake, no matter what the intent was, you&#39;re expected to name it and claim it. Admit your mistake, correct your behavior, and move on. Do not make excuses. Do not&nbsp;argue. And do not retaliate&nbsp;when you&#39;re challenged or called out for your mistake.&nbsp;Remember, intent does not matter; impact does. In addition, we ask our members to respectfully&nbsp;<strong>challenge systems of oppression, discrimination, harassment, and bullying</strong>&nbsp;when they occur. Change cannot happen if we do not voice up when these issues occur.</li>
	<li>We&nbsp;<strong>encourage our members to be open with, and get to know, each other.</strong>&nbsp;Being open enables us to be able to develop connections and gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of others. It also opens our minds up to seeing systems of oppression, as well as opening up to the necessary change to dismantle it.</li>
	<li>We ask that our members&nbsp;<strong>keep an open mind to change.</strong>&nbsp;We frown upon closed-mindedness in this community. In order to dismantle systems of oppression, change has to happen. And no change will occur if we face each other with closed minds.</li>
	<li>We ask that our members&nbsp;<strong>explore their discomforts&nbsp;</strong>rather than shelter themselves from them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Uncomfortable topics and discussion is likely in this community. When it happens, we ask that our members evaluate what about the discussion&nbsp;makes them uncomfortable. Does it conflict with a moral or value? Is that moral or value in need of change to better serve a progressive and just community? Have you had an experience relating to the topic that potentially may need confronting / discussing? Is your priviledge in need of checking? Is the topic new and unfamiliar to you and thus need research on?&nbsp;And so on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crises</h2>
All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been trained&nbsp;in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area. We ask you submit resources of your own to the database as well for others to utilize.

<h2>Inclusive and Respectful Language</h2>
<strong>We do not have a word filter&nbsp;</strong>on our website. We feel that word filters are annoying and prevent freedom of speech. On the same note however, we ask that you<strong> take care in the language you use</strong> on our website. We will not intervene for cursing on our website (unless it&#39;s very excessive). However, intervention may be necessary if you use language meant to insult or hurt other people, intentionally provoke drama and/or unconstructive argumentation, intentionally create disgust or triggered emotions, or discriminate against others.<br />

If you need assistance with understanding what terms are considered inclusive and what terms are not inclusive, you may do Google searches on inclusive language guides.

<h2><span style="font-size: 18.59px;">Profile Fields</span></h2>
In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled <strong>profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns</strong>. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).[/semihtml]
