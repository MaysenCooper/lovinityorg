[semihtml][title]Who We Are[/title]

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
The Lovinity Community+ is a <strong>safe and brave space website and Discord community</strong> where individuals may interact on advice, wisdom, activism, and current events. Individuals of all races, religions, orientations, and so forth are free to use our community. We provide numerous social tools, including an internet radio station, that members may use to socialize with each other.

<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
It is in The Lovinity Community+&#39;s hopes that through the use of our community, <strong>the lives and consciousness of individuals will be transformed</strong> in a positive way. We also hope that those who use our website will feel loved for who they are and will experience Lovinity.

<h2>What Does &quot;Lovinity&quot; Mean?</h2>
In our community, we frequently use the term &quot;Lovinity&quot;. In fact, it is a part of our name. Lovinity is a word consisting of the words <strong>divinity, infinity, and love</strong>. We hope that through our community, everyone will experience Lovinity, or divine infinite love. Everyone deserves love in its most pure and unconditional form.

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
Although our website is intended for socializing on advice, wisdom, and activism, our website is not intended to handle crisis situations or matters requiring professional help. For this reason, we have provided a <strong>resources section</strong> under the activism menu on our website that will list resources you can turn to for professional or crisis help. Members may also submit additional resources to the database for others to see. All submitted resources are periodically reviewed by staff.

<h2>Quick History</h2>
Generation 1 of The Lovinity Community+ began in 2014. Our focus at that time was simply to be a social community where others can exchange words of wisdom and seek advice. We also had an internet radio station. The website ran under ocPortal 9.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, lovinity.org went down in December 2015 due to a server corruption. Due to the low activity level, the website stayed down for some time.<br />
<br />
But in April 2016, The Lovinity Community came back as Generation 2, adding the + at the name to represent the new mission, vision, and software (now Composr CMS 10). In addition to advice and wisdom socializing, we now also focus on promoting activist causes. In addition to the internet radio stream, we also later added on a role playing section. We have plans to add an additional micronation section as well.<br />
<br />
Generation 2.1 of The Lovinity Community+ will run version 11 of Composr CMS, the software that serves our website. In addition, our community will have an added focus to encouraging each other to create quality content. We&#39;ll be introducing a couple new and exciting features to the community that are unique and fun. Stay tuned for a date in which Generation 2.1 will launch!<br />
