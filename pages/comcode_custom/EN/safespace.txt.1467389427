The Lovinity Community+ is a safe space website.
<ul>

		<li>*Individuals under 13 years of age must get parental consent to use our website as per the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Discrimination</strong> will not be tolerated in any way in our community. This includes micro-aggressions.</li>
	<li><strong>Harassment and bullying</strong> will also not be tolerated in our community.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for discrimination nor harassment/bullying here,&nbsp;even if it&#39;s religiously influenced.</li>
	<li>We do not permit <strong>sharing of content</strong> from this website anywhere outside of the website without explicit permission. You may&nbsp;post links on other websites directing to pages here, but may not copy/paste content directly from our website to other websites.</li>
	<li>Breaching or threatening to<strong> breach the security or stability of the website</strong> will result in an immediate permanent ban.</li>
	<li>All data exchanged between you and our website is <strong>encrypted</strong>. You can note this by seeing &quot;HTTPS&quot; in all our URLs.</li>
</ul>
Despite these safe space rules, we would like you to know<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that <strong>this website is meant to be a place where people can discuss controversial, emotional, and intense topics</strong>. Our Safe Space Policy is meant to ensure that everyone here, no matter how they identify, is treated with respect. However, our safe space policy is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;meant to be a way to prevent constructive dialogue about controversial, emotional, or intense topics. In fact, we encourage you to discuss such topics here, especially if they are important to you.<br />
<br />
All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been <strong>safe-space trained</strong> in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area. We ask you submit resources of your own to the database as well for others to utilize.

<h2>Inclusive and Respectful Language</h2>
<strong>We do not have a word filter&nbsp;</strong>on our website. We feel that word filters are annoying and prevent freedom of speech. On the same note however, we ask that you<strong> take care in the language you use</strong> on our website. We will not intervene for cursing on our website (unless it&#39;s very excessive). However, intervention may be necessary if you use language meant to insult or hurt other people, intentionally provoke drama and/or unconstructive argumentation, intentionally create disgust or triggered emotions, or discriminate against others.<br />
<br />
If you need assistance with understanding what terms are considered inclusive and what terms are not inclusive, you may do Google searches on inclusive language guides. Additionally, you may refer to this PDF document:&nbsp;https://www.girardatlarge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bias-Free-Language-Guide-Inclusive-Excellence-073015.pdf
<h2><span style="font-size: 18.59px;">Profile Fields</span></h2>
In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled <strong>profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns</strong>. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).[/semihtml]
