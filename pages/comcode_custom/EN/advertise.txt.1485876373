[contents levels="3"][/contents][title param=&quot;2&quot;]Banner Advertising[/title]At the top of every page on our website is a <strong>banner</strong>. You can create a banner ad for us to randomly display up there. Users can then click on the ad to be taken to a website of your choice.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Requirements[/title]

<ul>
	<li>Banner ads must be jpg, gif, or png images the size of 728x90 pixels.</li>
	<li>All website rules apply to the content you put in your banner.</li>
	<li>Your banner may not redirect users to malicious websites. We will check a website&#39;s reputation prior to approving a banner ad.</li>
	<li>Payment must be made in advance; we do not offer &quot;pay-as-they-click&quot;.</li>
	<li>Banners may not advertise actual prices for products or services, include comparison language (aka. &quot;We are the best there is&quot; or &quot;better than X company&quot;), nor include calls to action (aka. &quot;Buy our products&quot;). We are a non-profit entity.</li>
	<li>Banners may not endorse any political parties or candidates.</li>
	<li>Banners may not promote anything seen to be against progressive activism, such as&nbsp;encouraging discrimination&nbsp;or fabricating stereotypes (sexualized&nbsp;women&nbsp;for example).</li>
	<li>Unless you provide us with an expiration date, banners will expire after a determined amount of time (see &quot;costs&quot;). Any purchased clicks not used when the banner expires will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be refunded; what is left will instead&nbsp;go towards impressions of that banner (the times it showed).</li>
</ul>
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Costs[/title]You may pay for banner advertisements using U.S. Dollar equivalence (PayPal), or by using your Yang. Here are our <strong>current rates</strong>, subject to change without notice:<br />

The <strong>minimum purchase</strong> at this time is 5 clicks.<br />
Currently, your banner will <strong>expire</strong> in 30 days if you purchase 5 clicks. A day will be added for every additional click you purchased. This rate subject to change according to our traffic.<br />
<br />
*The<strong> importance modulus</strong> determines how often in random logic that the banner appears on the website&hellip; the higher the modulus, the more often it shows up. A banner with a modulus of 2 will show up 2X as often as one with a modulus of 1&hellip; and one with a modulus of 4 will show up 2X as often as one with 2, and 4X as much as one with 1&hellip; and so on.[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Advertising on our Internet Radio Station[/title]You can host <strong>underwritings on our internet radio station</strong>. Underwritings are similar to commercials or public service announcements but have some different restrictions, given we are non-profit. To request an underwriting on our internet radio station, please create a support ticket.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Requirements[/title]

<ul>
	<li>Underwritings must be recorded by us; you may provide the script as to what we should say as well as what background music to use.</li>
	<li>All website rules apply to what goes in your underwriting.</li>
	<li>Payment must be made in advance; we do not offer pay-as-it-airs.</li>
	<li>Underwritings&nbsp;may not advertise actual prices for products or services, include comparison language (aka. &quot;We are the best there is&quot; or &quot;better than X company&quot;), nor include calls to action (aka. &quot;Buy our products&quot;). We are a non-profit entity.</li>
	<li>Underwritings&nbsp;may not endorse any political parties or candidates.</li>
	<li>Underwritings&nbsp;may not promote anything seen to be against progressive activism, such as encouraging discrimination&nbsp;or fabricating stereotypes (sexualized&nbsp;women&nbsp;for example).</li>
	<li>After we record using your script, the underwriting may not exceed 60 seconds in length.</li>
	<li>All underwritings will be read in third person as the focus is The Lovinity Community Radio talking about you / your message, not you talking about your message. In addition, underwritings will begin with &quot;The Lovinity Community Radio thanks (insert entity name) for their support.&quot;</li>
</ul>
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Costs[/title]Underwritings are <strong>pay-per-air</strong>. Our station is designed so that each underwriting airs at most 4 times in a 24 hour period. Underwritings will not air during radio shows; they only air during off-air music times.<br />
<br />
If you specify an expiration date, all un-aired times will be refunded to you.
