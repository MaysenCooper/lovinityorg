For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
In an attempt to promote an inclusive environment for all people, our Safe Space policy also includes regulations on inclusive language. The staff expect you to adhere to this policy when communicating with others on site.<br />
Word filters are in place to prevent or auto-correct use of some of these problematic terms indicated in this policy. Any attempts to bypass the filter or this policy can result in disciplinary measures.<br />
The inclusive language policy is subject to change at any time without notice.
<h3>Forbidden terms</h3>

<h3>Automatically-correcting Terms</h3>
The following terms will be automatically corrected upon your submission in order to meet our guidelines for inclusive language:

<ul>
	<li>older person/people, elder, senior citizen - will be corrected to person/people of advanced age because it places emphasis on people, not on age.</li>
	<li>poor person/people, poverty-stricken person/people - will be corrected to person/people of low economic status because the statement places emphasis on person/people, not on their economic status. In addition, some people may choose to live in low economic status because of their beliefs, which does not make them &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;poverty-stricken&quot;.</li>
	<li>homeless person/people - will be corrected to person/people experiencing homelessness because it identifies person, not their state of home.</li>
	<li>rick person/people - will be corrected to person/people of high economic status because it identifies person, not the fact they are rich. The term rich people/person also implies one cannot be wealthy in other ways.</li>
	<li>overweight people/person, obese people/person - will be corrected to person/people of size because overweight and obese have different standards depending on culture and are medical terms that should not be used to define someone.</li>
