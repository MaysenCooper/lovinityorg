<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
The Lovinity Community+ is a safe space website community where individuals may interact on advice, wisdom, and activism. Individuals of all races, religions, orientations, and so forth are free to use our community without discrimination. We provide numerous social tools, including an internet radio station, that members may use to socialize with each other.

<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
It is in The Lovinity Community+&#39;s hopes that through the use of our community, the lives and consciousness of individuals will be transformed in a positive way. We also hope that those who use our website will feel loved for who they are and will experience Lovinity.

<h2>What Does &quot;Lovinity&quot; Mean?</h2>
In our community, we frequently use the term &quot;Lovinity&quot;. In fact, it is a part of our name. Lovinity is a word consisting of the words divine, infinity, and love. We hope that through our community, everyone will experience Lovinity, or divine infinite love. Everyone deserves love in its most pure and unconditional form.

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
Although our website is intended for socializing on advice, wisdom, and activism, our website is not intended to handle crisis situations or matters requiring professional help. For this reason, we have provided a resources section under the activism menu on our website that will list resources you can turn to for professional or crisis help. Members may also submit additional resources to the database for others to see. All submitted resources are periodically reviewed by staff.<br />
