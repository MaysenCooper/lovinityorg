[contents levels="3"][/contents][title param=&quot;2&quot;]Rewards[/title]Being staff on TLC+ is a&nbsp;<strong>non-paid voluntary commitment</strong>. We are a non-profit entity and do not have it in our budget to pay staff. However, you will be rewarded through earning Yang (our virtual currency) as well as other things. Your experience as a staff member could also be mentioned on your resume for future jobs.[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Duties[/title][title param=&quot;3&quot;]Administrators[/title]Administrators oversee everything on The Lovinity Community+. They are in charge of taking in new staff members as well and relieving staff found to be inactive or not capable of meeting the needs of their position. They make the big decisions for the website. And they guide the rest of the staff and the teams.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Advisers[/title]Advisers are professionals and have a professional degree in a field relating to the area of the community they are advising. Advisers work with administrators on making the big decisions, but are not held to as high of activity standards as the rest of the staff; they&#39;re only there when needed.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Moderators[/title]Moderators are in charge of moderating and reviewing content submitted to The Lovinity Community+. They approve or reject any content that have been flagged for approval (either via being in probation, setting staff bypass on a new content to OFF, or a mandatory moderator check) depending on whether or not it follows our rules. They issue accountability statements and prosecution / discipline when necessary. They intervene on conflicts experienced on the website. And they maintain user reputation/credibility.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Developers[/title]Developers work on the back end of the website. They do the coding of new features, improve on existing features, fix bugs, perform routine maintenance, and maintain website backups.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Ambassadors[/title]Ambassadors are the outside voice of The Lovinity Community+. They establish relations with other organizations and entities. They promote our community in an attempt to get more members. They proofread correspondance such as our newsletters. And they manage advertising.[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Mentors[/title]Mentors are our internal voices of The Lovinity Community+. They go around helping users who need help or someone to talk to. They welcome new members. They actively engage within the community to help stimulate discussion. And they help manage special community events.[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Requirements[/title][title param=&quot;3&quot;]All staff[/title]

[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Solidarity Mode[/title]When a major tragedy occurs in the world, Lovinity will sometimes declare Solidarity Mode on The Lovinity Community+. When solidarity mode is declared, staff are required to spend at minimum 8 hours each day during solidarity mode on the website. That way, users can turn to a staff for comfort or grievance. Any staff who cannot make this commitment must report to Lovinity within 16 hours of solidarity mode being declared with a good justifiable reason why they cannot make the commitment. Any staff who fail to make the commitment and fail to provide good reasoning as to why they couldn&#39;t could be suspended from their position for a length of time determined by Lovinity.<br />
