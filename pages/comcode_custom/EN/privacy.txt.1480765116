<h2>Notes on what is done with information you submit</h2>
The staff reserve the right to read any content submitted to this website, including private content, Private Topics, and Instant Messaging conversations. <strong>Any form of conversation made through this website should be considered viewable by staff.</strong> All content and posts, whether &#39;deleted&#39; or not, are stored on the server and in backups and may be reviewed if we feel we have cause for an investigation. If you want to keep something completely private, do not use our services for transmitting it. It is also wise not to use any internet service to transmit private data because privacy is never guaranteed online.<br />
<br />
Despite the above, staff are under strict regulations not to share any private content nor information with anyone unless legally required to do so, or unless the information involved relates to an investigation of a rule violation. And they are only to share information with the parties involved in the investigation. If you feel any staff member is violating this, please contact @Lovinity directly in a Private Topic.
<h2>Search Engines</h2>
In order to drive traffic to The Lovinity Community+, search engines crawl our website. Crawling entails going through the website and grabbing content that can be used on search engines to list this website and sections of this website.<br />
<br />
<strong>All public content and information you submit to TLC+ can be indexed by search engines.</strong>&nbsp;However, content that cannot be viewed by guests, such as posts in member-only forums, or content where the privacy setting is not set to &quot;everyone&quot;, cannot be indexed; search engines will get an access denied error when they try.<br />
<br />
We have no control nor responsibility over what search engines index from our website. If something got indexed on a search engine that you feel violates your right to privacy, contact the&nbsp;<strong>search engine</strong>&nbsp;in question; do not contact The Lovinity Community+.

<h2>Emails</h2>
Our website sends out email notifications to our members for different website activity. Some of these notifications may be changed in terms of settings from your profile. Others cannot be changed. To see what settings can and cannot be changed, see&nbsp;<a class="user_link" href="https://lovinity.org/catalogues/entry/website-functionality/what-notifications-can.htm">This FAQ entry on notification settings</a>&nbsp;.<br />
The Lovinity Community+ also sends weekly newsletters to everyone of the latest website news. We may also send bulk emails for high priority news.<br />
We will not send email to others which we would consider to be spam.<br />

<h2>Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
In order for children under the age of thirteen (13) to join this website, the legal guardian of the child must also have an account on our website and have verified the child to be their legal responsibility. This is in accordance with U.S. law, but is applied internationally as a civil standard.<br />
<br />
A notice will be sent, by e-mail, to the e-mail address given when a child joins, which will provide notice on how to approve the membership.<br />
<br />
The parent or guardian has the option to agree to the collection and use of the child&#39;s information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. Regardless how the parent or guardian consents, it is still required that the parent or guardian has an account on The Lovinity Community+. This is to ensure safety of the child and so the child has a spokes person in the event the child gets bullied or ends up in some other dispute on our website.<br />
<br />
{$SITE_NAME} may not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.<br />
<br />
The parent or guardian can review the child&#39;s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child&#39;s information. This may be done by contacting the staff at support@lovinity.org or filing a support ticket under Help -&gt; Tickets / Contact.{+END}<br />

<h2>Spam checking</h2>
For the purpose of reducing spam:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<ol type="1">
	<li>Your IP address, e-mail address, and username, may be checked against the <a class="user_link" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/" rel=" external" target="_blank" title="Stop Forum Spam (this link will open in a new window)">Stop Forum Spam</a> web service, which involves these details being transmitted within a service request.</li>
	<li>Your IP address may be checked against multiple block lists, which involves these details being transmitted within a service request.</li>
	<li>If staff have reasonable suspicion that you are a spammer, they may transmit your IP address, email address, username, and/or other relevant information to spam databases to check if you have a reputation for spamming other websites.</li>
</ol>
