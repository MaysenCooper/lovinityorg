[semihtml][title]1. Non-Disclosure agreement[/title]
User privacy on The Lovinity Community+ is extremely important for the confientiality, safety, and security of all. Therefore as part of being a staff member on this website, you agree to abide by this Non-Disclosure Agreement.<br />
<br />
Since privacy is a very important business here,<strong>&nbsp;failure to uphold the Non-Disclosure Agreement can and will result in your termination as a staff member with additional disciplinary actions on your account.</strong>

<h2>Rules</h2>
As a staff member, you agree to uphold and follow the <a href="https://lovinity.org/forum/rules">Rules</a>&nbsp;in full, including the Terms of Use, Safe Space Policy, and Privacy Policy.

<h2>Sharing of Content</h2>
As a staff member, you are not to share any content from within The Lovinity Community+ website to other locations without explicit permission from all parties involved in such content. The exception to this rule is if you share links pointed to non-private content on this website. This rule is especially true for sensitive areas, such as specific forums.

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
As a staff member, you will have access to very personal and sensitive information about other staff and users. Some sensitive information you may come across include but are not limited to private topics, instant messages, private content, IP addresses, emails, users&#39; karma levels, past discipline on users, user and staff reputation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The following rules apply to this information you have access to:
<ul>
	<li>You are not to access any sensitive information about other users or staff without just cause, defined as doing so in order to complete your staff duties. An example of an acceptable time to access information is investigating reports on some content or member.</li>
	<li>Any and all sensitive information you&nbsp;get access to may NOT be shared with anyone else, except other staff members for the purpose of completing your duty.</li>
	<li>You may not use any information you have access to to make personal decisions, such as using information as a means to look down on or harass/attack someone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Duration of this agreement</h2>
This agreement applies to all staff. The moment you are contracted to this agreement, this agreement will apply to you and all sensitive information you obtain about others for as long as you use The Lovinity Community+, even if you later lose your staff position. Violation of this contract can and will result in serious consequences, including legal action if warranted.

<h2>No signature?&nbsp;No&nbsp;position.</h2>
All staff must sign and agree to this agreement regardless whether or not you agree with it. If a valid signature of yours for this agreement is not on file, then you are not considered an official staff member of The Lovinity Community+; a signature is a requirement to be a staff member. No exceptions.

<h2>Subject to change</h2>
This agreement is subject to revisions without notice. When a revision is made&hellip; if you already signed the agreement and a signature of yours is on file, your signature also indicates your agreement that you automatically agree to all revisions as they are made regardless of whether or not you knew about them. Therefore, it is critical you read this agreement frequently.<br />
