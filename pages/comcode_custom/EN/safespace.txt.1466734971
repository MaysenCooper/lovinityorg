<br />
The Lovinity Community+ is a safe space website.
<ul>
	<li>People of all races, ethnicities, sexes, gender identities, sexual orientations, ranges of abilities, ages*, social economic classes, religions, cultures, political stances, nationalities, and so on may use our website without being discriminated.
	<ul>
		<li>*Individuals under 13 years of age must get parental consent to use our website as per the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Discrimination will not be tolerated in any way in our community. This includes micro-aggressions.</li>
	<li>Harassment and bullying will also not be tolerated in our community.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for discrimination nor harassment/bullying here,&nbsp;even if it&#39;s religiously influenced.</li>
	<li>We do not permit sharing of content from this website anywhere outside of the website without explicit permission. You may&nbsp;post links on other websites directing to pages here, but may not copy/paste content directly from our website to other websites.</li>

</ul>
All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been safe-space trained in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
We do not have an automatic word filter in our community. Keep in mind, however, that The Lovinity Community+ still enforces this inclusive language policy. The purpose of this policy is to promote an inclusive environment for everyone as well as minimize the use of derogatory terms and hate speech. You are expected to adhere to these policies in all communication that takes place on our website. Though disciplinary action is usually not given for infrequent violations, staff have the right to discipline those who have little to no regard for this policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our inclusive language policy is especially open to feedback as making a safe space is a community effort.&nbsp;</strong>If you disagree with certain aspects of our policy, please email support@lovinity.org or file a support ticket under about -&gt; support tickets . If multiple people have the same concerns, we&#39;ll consider revising the policy.

<h3>Terms with appropriate and inappropriate use</h3>

In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).<br />

These language policies may change at any time without notice as language constantly changes.<br />
