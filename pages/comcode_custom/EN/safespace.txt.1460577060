The Lovinity Community+ is a safe space website.
<ul>
	<li>People of all races, ethnicities, sexes, gender identities, sexual orientations, ranges of abilities, ages*, social economic classes, religions, cultures, political stances, nationalities, and so on may use our website without being discriminated.
	<ul>
		<li>*Individuals under 13 years of age must get parental consent to use our website as per the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Discrimination will not be tolerated in any way in our community. This includes micro-aggressions.</li>
	<li>Harassment and bullying will also not be tolerated in our community.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for discrimination nor harassment/bullying here,&nbsp;even if it&#39;s religiously influenced.</li>
	<li>We do not permit sharing of content from this website anywhere outside of the website without explicit permission. You may&nbsp;post links on other websites directing to pages here, but may not copy/paste content directly from our website to other websites.</li>
	<li>Breaching or threatening to breach the security or stability of the website will result in an immediate permanent ban.</li>
	<li>All data exchanged between you and our website is encrypted. You can note this by seeing &quot;HTTPS&quot; in all our URLs.</li>
</ul>
All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been safe-space trained in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
In an attempt to promote an inclusive environment for all people, our Safe Space policy also includes regulations on inclusive language. The staff expect you to adhere to this policy when communicating with others on site. Not doing so can result in disciplinary measures especially if done intentionally or repeatedly. These regulations are in place in order to respect the identities of all individuals and to minimize stereotypes and microaggressions.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pronouns:&nbsp;</strong>If a member on our website has specified what the member&#39;s preferred pronouns are in their profile info, you are expected to refer to that member by their preferred pronoun, even if it does not conform to their gender identity (for example, if someone who identifies as a guy does not indicate &quot;he&quot; as a preferred pronoun, do not use it even though&nbsp;they identify as a guy).</li>
	<li><strong>Age</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Use: People of advanced age</li>
		<li>Do not use: older people, elders, seniors, senior citizens</li>
		<li>Reason: &quot;People of advanced age&quot; places emphasis on people, not on the age.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Class</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Use: Person of low economic status</li>
		<li>Do not use: Ghetto person, poor person, poverty-stricken person</li>
		<li>Reason: Person of low economic class places emphasis on person, not on class. In addition, some people may choose to live in low economic status because of their beliefs, but that does not make them poor.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person experiencing homelessness, person using welfare</li>
		<li>Do not use: Homeless person, the homeless, welfare queen/king</li>
		<li>Reason: Homeless person and the homeless both define someone by the status of their home rather than by the person. Welfare queen/king is an insult to those who may have had no other option.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person of high economic status</li>
		<li>Do not use: rich person, wealthy person (when referring to how much money they have)</li>
		<li>Reason: Rich person puts emphasis on rich, defining them by their wealth. It also implies that people without high status cannot be wealthy in other ways, which is not true. Using wealthy person when defining someone with high economic status can imply the same thing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Weight / Size</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Use: People of size</li>
		<li>Do not use: Obese, overweight, fat</li>
		<li>Reason: Obese is a medical term. Overweight and obese both have different standards depending on culture. Fat is a subjective term and also frequently used as an insult. All three define someone based on size whereas people of size places emphasis on people, not size.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: People of small size</li>
		<li>Do not use: Skinny, anorexic, sick</li>
		<li>Reason: Anorexic and sick are medical diagnoses and do not necessarily correlate with one&#39;s size. Skinny defines someone based on their size. People of small size defines someone by people, not by size.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Statuses of ability</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Be careful of the metaphors. Do not use real medical disabilities, such as &quot;Bipolar&quot;, &quot;Autistic&quot;, and &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;, to describe people.</li>
		<li>Do not mention one&#39;s disability unless it is relevant.</li>
		<li>Do not cast a disability in negative light. Avoid saying someone &quot;suffers&quot; from, &quot;is a victim&quot; of, etc.</li>
		<li>Do not use the terms handicapped, challenged, nor crippled.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person of no disabilities</li>
		<li>Do not use: normal, able-bodied, healthy, whole, standard</li>
		<li>Reason: The language indicated in &quot;do not use&quot; casts the stigma that it is wrong to be disabled.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person who is blind, person who is visually-impaired</li>
		<li>Do not use: Blind person, &quot;dumb&quot; person</li>
		<li>Reason: The terms preferred focus on the individual and not on the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person who is deaf, person who is hard of hearing</li>
		<li>Do not use: deaf person, deaf-mute, deaf-and-dumb</li>
		<li>Reason: The terms preferred define the person and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person with a speech impairment</li>
		<li>Do not use: Dumb, speech impediment, Slurring person, mute</li>
		<li>Reason: Preferred terms define the individual and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person with a learning disability, person with a cognative disability, person with a developmental disability</li>
		<li>Do not use: retarded, slow, brain-damaged, brain-impaired, special education student, special ed student</li>
		<li>Reason: Preferred terms define the individual and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person who uses a wheelchair, person who is physically disabled,&nbsp;quadriplegic, paraplegic</li>
		<li>Do not use: Handicapped, physically challenged, invalid, special, deformed, cripple, gimp, spaz, wheelchair-bound, confined to a wheelchair, lame</li>
		<li>Reason: Preferred terms define the individual and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person seeking emotional support, person who identifies with an emotional mental disability</li>
		<li>Do not use: emotionally/mentally challenged, emotionally/mentally disturbed</li>
		<li>Reason:&nbsp;Preferred terms define the individual and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: Person of short stature</li>
		<li>Do not&nbsp;use: Dwarf, midget, little person</li>
		<li>Reason: Preferred terms define the individual and not the disability.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Use: person living with a disability, person identifying with a disability</li>
		<li>Do not use: suffers from, is a victim of, stricken with, afflicted with, confined to</li>
		<li>Reason: Disabilities are not negative. They are another way for people to do the same things that people with no disabilities do.</li>
