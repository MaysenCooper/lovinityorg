	<li><strong>Discrimination</strong> will not be tolerated in any way in our community. This includes micro-aggressions.</li>
	<li><strong>Harassment and bullying</strong> will also not be tolerated in our community.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no excuse</strong> for discrimination nor harassment/bullying here,&nbsp;even if it&#39;s religiously influenced.</li>
	<li>We do not permit <strong>sharing of content</strong> from this website anywhere outside of the website without explicit permission. You may&nbsp;post links on other websites directing to pages here, but may not copy/paste content directly from our website to other websites.</li>

All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been <strong>safe-space trained</strong> in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
We do not have an automatic word filter in our community. Keep in mind, however, that The Lovinity Community+ still enforces this inclusive language policy. The purpose of this policy is to <strong>promote an inclusive environment for everyone</strong> as well as minimize the use of derogatory terms and hate speech. You are expected to adhere to these policies in all communication that takes place on our website.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It may seem like there are a lot of terms in our policy, which there are. But we <strong>will not discipline violations</strong> of the inclusive language policy unless we have reason to believe you are not taking the policy seriously. Otherwise, staff will simply correct you and give you a private message to inform you of the violation without issuing discipline.<br />
<br />
If you <strong>disagree</strong> with certain aspects of our policy, please email support@lovinity.org or file a support ticket under about -&gt; support tickets . If multiple people have the same concerns, we&#39;ll consider revising the policy.

<h3>Terms with appropriate and inappropriate use</h3>
These terms have times and contexts in which they may be used, and times and contexts in which they may not be used.<br />

In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled <strong>profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns</strong>. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).<br />

These language policies may change at any time without notice as language constantly changes.<br />
