<h2>Support</h2>
There are many ways you can offer support to others, especially if they identify in the LGBT community. However you offer support, there are some key things you should remember:

<ul>
	<li>Follow LARA:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Listen</strong>&nbsp;to others and what they have to say.</li>
		<li><strong>Affirm</strong>&nbsp;that everyone is beautiful, no matter how they identify.</li>
		<li><strong>Respond&nbsp;</strong>when discrimination takes place</li>
		<li><strong>Add</strong>&nbsp;to the discussions and contributions of the LGBT community.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Work&nbsp;<strong>with</strong>&nbsp;people, not&nbsp;<strong>for</strong>&nbsp;people. If you are an ally for a group of people you don&#39;t necessarily identify in yourself, you need to realise that ultimately the work of dismantling oppression must be done by those who do identify as such. Offer your support to them rather than trying to speak and act on behalf of them.</li>
	<li><strong>Accommodate everyone.</strong>&nbsp;There will be a vast number of different people who have different identities gathering together in a group or an ally system. That&#39;s how intersectionality works. It is important to acknowledge intersectionality and make sure everyone feels welcomed in the support system or activist movement.</li>
	<li><strong>Be aware of images and content.&nbsp;</strong>Pay attention to the messages portrayed in various media, advertisements, song lyrics, art, and more. Identify key elements of oppression in these works,&nbsp;and challenge them. Also do not let these oppressing messages influence your way of thinking and behaviour. Stay strong and learn to filter these messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intervention</h2>
When oppression or discrimination occurs, it is important to intervene respectfully on it in order to promote a safe environment and to help others learn. Remember, not everyone is familiar with gender identities, systems of oppression, and so on. I am going to cover three main ways you can intervene on such matters.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Distract</strong>: Though not an ideal intervention method unless necessary (say, to stop drama), you can distract others by changing the topic to something else. For instance, if people are spouting hate speech about transsexuals, you can distract the conversation by initiating discussion on how the media portrays women (just make sure it&#39;s relevant for the section of the website it&#39;s in).</li>
	<li><strong>Delegate</strong>: Should you find yourself unable to intervene or help out, but acknowledge what is happening needs to be addressed, you can delegate your energy. This means getting other people to help you (such as staff), finding resources or people you can refer the problematic users to for education on the topic, and so on.</li>
	<li><strong>Direct:&nbsp;</strong>This means calling out and challenging the oppression or discrimination directly. Name the problem, claim/confront the problem, and then resolve the problem. This is usually in the form of issuing accountability statements or disciplinary actions on our website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes</h2>
We all make mistakes. Even staff make mistakes. We&#39;re human, and therefore unfortunately prone to making mistakes. But how we approach and handle our mistakes can mean the difference between people respecting you and people hating you. It can also mean the difference between others feeling respected or others feeling hated. Therefore, it is important you follow these tips when you find yourself making a mistake or being confronted for a mistake:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Be open to correction and change.&nbsp;</strong>Do not try to defend yourself,&nbsp;deflect confrontation, nor explain how you were not at fault. Be open to the possibility that you made a mistake, whether or not you actually did. Consider the feedback and responses you receive from others (but please discuss them with other staff as well so we can all improve together). Remember, there is always room for improvement.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid making excuses.</strong>&nbsp;Excuses only show others that you are not truly listening nor being open and willing to change and learn from your mistakes. Own the mistake, apologise, and change yourself and what you do to better serve others.</li>
	<li><strong>Show up, not off.&nbsp;</strong>Be present in the conversations to own your mistakes, apologise, and be open to correction. Do not present yourself in conversations to show off your mistake, justify it, make excuses, explain why you were not at fault, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<b>The CEO, Lovinity, strictly does not tolerate staff who try to make excuses for their mistakes nor refuse to own up to them,&nbsp;</b>and staff who do this may be asked to participate in an intervention with Lovinity. Ultimately, staff who continue to exhibit this kind of behaviour will be dismissed from their positions.<br />
<br />
If you are being accused of a mistake that you truly and honestly do not feel you&#39;re at fault,&nbsp;<strong>do NOT respond to the accusers</strong>&nbsp;until after you turn to staff, especially Lovinity, for guidance.

<h2>Impact &gt; Intent</h2>
Remember, <strong>impact over intent.</strong> Here on The Lovinity Community+, discipline and how others are held accountable is no different between someone who intentionally made the mistake and someone who unintentionally made the mistake. Discipline and accountability is based off of the impact it has had in the community, not the intent of the user in violation. The reason for this is because even if the mistake is unintentional, it still causes harm, users are still responsible for it, and they are also responsible for learning and growing from that mistake. Intentional or unintentional, they&#39;re expected to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Lovinity does not tolerate giving users more lenient discipline or &quot;free passes&quot; for unintentional violations.</strong> All users are expected to be held responsible for their actions regardless of intent. Staff found to be basing discipline based on intent and not impact will be required to have an intervention with Lovinity and may ultimately lose their position if it continues.<br />
