<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Disciplinary System[/title]</kbd>We have a disciplinary system in place on The Lovinity Community+. This system is designed to educate members who violate the rules, correct problematic behavior, and protect the safety and integrity of our community.<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Punishments / Karma System[/title]</kbd>Our website runs on a Karma system as well as a warrant/prosecution system in terms of rule violations.&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Trivial first time violations may result in a simple message from a staff member, rather than going through the warrant/prosecution procedure below.</li>
	<li>When you violate a rule, you will usually first be issued a warrant. A warrant is a notification that staff have determined you were in violation of the rules, and that you have 72 hours to reply with a defense statement (optional) before a final decision is made on what discipline staff will issue you. Most of the time, staff will issue preventive discipline immediately with a warrant, such as hiding violating content or silencing you from a forum or forum topic. But point fines, karma reductions, suspensions, and bans are not immediately issued unless necessary.</li>
	<li>After the 72 hour period, staff will review the case, as well as, if provided, your defense statement, to make a final decision. If staff determine discipline is necessary, you will be given a prosecution and&nbsp;your karma will be reduced. The amount of Karma that is reduced is determined by staff and depends on the severity of your violations. Karma reductions also typically carry a fine of points. Karma can be rebuilt slowly over time by logging in to the website daily.
	<ul>
		<li>Technically, Karma is measured on a percentage scale from 0 to 100 with 100 being best. For simplicity, you will instead see your Karma represented as a 5-star / grading scale on your profile about page.&nbsp;Karma grades are&nbsp;on the following scale in order from highest to lowest: A+, A, B, C, D, F, X.</li>
		<li>The first time your Karma drops to level X (0%), you will be suspended from The Lovinity Community+. When suspended, you can still use the website as a guest but cannot log in.&nbsp;Suspension typically lasts 7-14 days. After that time, you must contact staff and complete a few educational tasks before your suspension is lifted. After your suspension is lifted, your Karma will be level D (20%).</li>
		<li>Reaching level X again after the first time&nbsp;will result in staff consideration for either issuing another suspension or issuing a permanent ban. If a permanent ban is issued, your access to our website will be denied completely and you will no longer be welcomed in our community.</li>
		<li>Some special features on our website, including requirements to apply for a staff position, may depend on you having a minimum level of Karma at the time.</li>
		<li>When Karma is lost, it is slowly rebuilt over time for every day you log in to our website. Your Karma will increase by 2%&nbsp;for every day you log in. This equates to one grade level every 10 days.</li>
		<li>All new users start out at Karma A+ (100%).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In addition to the above, staff may decide to silence you from a forum or topic for a period of time if the violation happened in the forums. Staff may also restrict your privileges depending on the rules violated.</li>
	<li>In addition, staff may issue a period of probation time if the need is present. During probation, your access to our website will be limited. Most content you submit during probation time will require staff approval before it is fully submitted.</li>
	<li>Staff will generally follow these guidelines, but do not have to. It is the staff&#39;s discretion to decide what to do and what is best and most fair. For example, if a user is causing a severe problem, staff may bypass the warrant stage and immediately prosecute.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Note about Discipline[/title]</kbd>Because of the nature of this website, in order to protect the security, safety, and integrity of The Lovinity Community+ and its members, our staff are strict/picky when it comes to rule enforcement. On the same note however, The Lovinity Community+ takes on an education-before-discipline approach. Discipline is only issued if staff feel the disciplinary action would be of benefit to the member and/or the community. We also don&#39;t ban users unless we feel it is absolutely necessary. A ban is seen as necessary if one of the following is true:

<ul>
	<li>All other methods of corrective behavior have been ineffective (warnings, point fines, permission restrictions, probation, suspension, etc.)</li>
	<li>The user clearly has no intention to follow the rules and intends to cause harm.</li>
	<li>It is obvious many users are bothered by such problematic user and a ban would be best to settle the conflicts.</li>
	<li>The user attempted or threatened website hacks, promoted or organized crime on-site, or engaged in sexual conversation with or posted sexual content of people under 18 years old.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Disciplinary Appeals[/title]</kbd>With most Disciplinary Actions / Prosecutions given to you, you may file an appeal if you feel the decision made was unfair or you want to do good to get a little bit of a lift in your discipline. To file an appeal, create a support ticket (About -&gt; Support Tickets, or email support@lovinity.org ) or reply to the private topic that you received when you were issued discipline.<br />
<br />
Technically, if you went through the warrant stage of the disciplinary procedure, you already attempted a form of appeal (your defense statement). However most of the time warrant defense statements are reviewed only by the staff who issued the warrant. Actual appeals, however, are required to be reviewed by more than one staff member.<br />

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Name of Appeal</th>
			<th scope="col">Description of Appeal</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Full</th>
			<td>Make a full appeal when you feel discipline was unfairly given to you. Include proof / justification as to why the discipline was unfair or unjust (apologies are not acceptable for a full appeal; see partial appeal). All disciplinary measures including the karma are removed/recovered in a successful full appeal; it essentially gets wiped from your records.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Partial</th>
			<td>File a partial appeal if you wish to complete a couple tasks given by the staff in exchange for having the points charged for your sanction returned to you. These tasks are meant to help you understand what you did as well as perform a form of giving back to the community. In a successful partial appeal, your points are returned and half of the karma lost is returned. However any other restrictions will remain in place.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Suspension</th>
			<td>File a suspension appeal after your suspension time is up in order to have your suspension lifted. Then follow the instructions given to you by staff in a timely manner, which usually includes completing tasks to educate you on what we do and do not tolerate. Compliance is necessary in the appeal. Failure to complete the appeal will result in an extension of the suspension or a permanent ban.</td>
