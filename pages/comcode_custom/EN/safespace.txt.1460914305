However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
In an attempt to promote an inclusive environment for all people, our Safe Space policy also includes regulations on inclusive language. The staff expect you to adhere to this policy when communicating with others on site.<br />
Word filters are in place to prevent or auto-correct use of some of these problematic terms indicated in this policy. Any attempts to bypass the filter or this policy can result in disciplinary measures.<br />
The inclusive language policy is subject to change at any time without notice.

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). Not doing so can result in intervention. We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).<br />
<br />
These language policies may change at any time without notice as language constantly changes.<br />
<br />
The language policy is tied in with our word filtering system. Therefore any attempts to bypass the inclusive language policy / word filters can result in staff intervention.<br />
