<h4>Solidarity Mode</h4>
When a major tragedy occurs in the world, Lovinity will sometimes declare Solidarity Mode on The Lovinity Community+. When solidarity mode is declared, staff are required to spend at minimum 8 hours each day during solidarity mode on the website. That way, users can turn to a staff for comfort or grievance. Any staff who cannot make this commitment must report to Lovinity within 12 hours of solidarity mode being declared with a good justifiable reason why they cannot make the commitment. Any staff who fail to make the commitment and fail to provide good reasoning as to why they couldn&#39;t could be suspended from their position for a length of time determined by Lovinity.<br />
<br />
Solidarity mode is only declared for tragedies in which multiple countries are mourning from, and usually only lasts 1-3 days when declared. Here is a recent history of when Solidarity mode was declared:
