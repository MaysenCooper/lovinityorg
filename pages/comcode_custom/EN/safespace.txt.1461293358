All staff of the Lovinity Community+ have been safe-space trained in order to know how to handle issues in an all-inclusive non-discriminating way. However, staff have not been trained in dealing with crisis situations, such as suicidal members, other than to provide calm support and to guide members to appropriate resources. For crisis situations or situations requiring professional support, please check out the resources section under the Activism menu or look for resources and hotlines in your area.

<h2>Inclusive Language Policy</h2>
In an attempt to promote an inclusive environment for all people, our Safe Space policy also includes regulations on inclusive language. The staff expect you to adhere to this policy when communicating with others on site.<br />
Word filters are in place to prevent or auto-correct use of some of these problematic terms indicated in this policy. Any attempts to bypass the filter or this policy can result in disciplinary measures.<br />
The inclusive language policy is subject to change at any time without notice.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our inclusive language policy is especially open to feedback as making a safe space is a community effort.&nbsp;</strong>If you disagree with certain aspects of our policy, please email support@lovinity.org or file a support ticket under about -&gt; support tickets . If multiple people have the same concerns, we&#39;ll consider revising the policy.

<h3>Terms you should not use; what to use instead</h3>
The following terms are not inclusive. Although your submission will not be rejected for using these terms, you are asked to avoid using them and instead use the suggested term. Repeated use of non-inclusive terms can result in staff intervention:

<ul>
	<li>Do not use: older person/people, elder, senior citizen<br />
	Use: Person/people of advanced age<br />
	Why?: The emphasis is on the person and not their age</li>
	<li>Do not use: poor person/people, poverty-stricken person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of low economic status<br />
	Why: the statement places emphasis on person/people, not on their economic status. In addition, some people may choose to live in low economic status because of their beliefs, which does not make them &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;poverty-stricken&quot;.</li>
	<li>Do not use: homeless person/people<br />
	Use: person/people experiencing homelessness<br />
	Why:&nbsp;it identifies person, not their state of home.</li>
	<li>Do not use: rich person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of high economic status<br />
	Why:&nbsp;it identifies person, not the fact they are rich. The term rich people/person also implies one cannot be wealthy in other ways.</li>
	<li>Do not use: overweight people/person, obese people/person<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of size<br />
	Why: overweight and obese have different standards depending on culture and are medical terms that should not be used to define someone.</li>
	<li>Do not use: Skinny/anorexic&nbsp;person/people, sick person/people (when referring to weight)<br />
	Use: Person/people of small size<br />
	Why: Emphasis is on person and not their size. Also, anorexia is a medical disorder and should not be used to identify someone. Also, sick defines that the person should not be that small, which is not always the case.</li>
	<li>When stating someone&#39;s disability, do not use: suffers from, stricken with, afflicted with<br />
	Use: lives with<br />
	Why:&nbsp;these terms put a negative light on disabilities and illnesses.</li>
	<li>Do not use: able-bodied person/people, whole person/people<br />
	Use: person/people with no disabilities<br />
	Why: Able-bodied implies those with a disability cannot perform regular tasks, which is not always true.&nbsp;The term whole casts the stigma that it&#39;s not okay to be disabled.</li>
	<li>Do not use: blind person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people who is/are visually impaired</li>
	<li>Do not use: deaf person/people<br />

	Use: person/people with a speech impairment</li>
	<li>Do not use: little person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of short stature</li>
	<li>Do not use: colored/dark person/people<br />
	Use:&nbsp;person/people of color<br />

	Use:&nbsp;person/people of multiple races</li>

	Use:&nbsp;multiple races<br />
	Why:&nbsp;mixed race is an inaccurate term</li>
	<li>Do not use: sexual preference<br />
	Use: sexual orientation<br />
	Why: sexual orientation is not something one prefers or chooses.</li>
	<li>Do not use: Various terms that gender occupational roles in society and jobs<br />
	Use: more gender neutral terms. For example, use mailperson instead of mailman. Housemaker instead of housewife. Chairperson instead of chairman. Etc.</li>
	<li>Do not use: women&#39;s lib/liberation<br />
	Use:&nbsp;feminism<br />
	Why: women&#39;s liberation implies women superiority, which is not what feminism is about</li>
	<li>Do not use: wife/husband<br />
	Use: significant other<br />
	Why: to be more gender neutral</li>
	<li>Do not use: mothering/fathering<br />

	Why:&nbsp;sex and gender are not binary.</li>
	<li>Do not use: biological/genetic/natal/normal gender<br />

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
In order to be an inclusive website, we have enabled profile fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns. You are expected to refer to other members either by their username or by their indicated preferred pronouns (if none are provided, use the gender neutral term &quot;they&quot;). Not doing so can result in intervention. We also ask you refer to people outside of our website by their preferred pronouns as well (if you don&#39;t know it, use the gender neutral pronoun &quot;they&quot;).<br />
<br />
These language policies may change at any time without notice as language constantly changes.<br />
<br />
The language policy is tied in with our word filtering system. Therefore any attempts to bypass the inclusive language policy / word filters can result in staff intervention.<br />
