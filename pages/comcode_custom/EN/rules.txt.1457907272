<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Disciplinary System[/title]</kbd>We have a disciplinary system in place on The Lovinity Community+. This system is designed to educate members who violate the rules, correct problematic behavior, and protect the safety and integrity of our community.<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Punishments[/title]</kbd>Our website typically operates on a &quot;ball game&quot; disciplinary system for rule violations. Violating any of our rules will result in a private message from staff, corrective actions by staff, and the following:

<ul>
	<li>Minor, first time violations will result in a simple warning that will not hold weight against you.</li>
	<li>More significant / non-first-time violations will result in a strike against your account. Strikes hold weight against you and do not expire (unless fully appealed). Strikes also usually carry a fine of points and possible permission restrictions.
	<ul>
		<li>Your third (3) strike will result in suspension from our website. During suspension, you cannot log in to your account. You will be asked to wait a period of time (usually 7-14 days) and then contact staff to have your suspension appealed. Appealing a suspension typically requires the completion of educational tasks designed to help you understand what we do and do not tolerate.</li>
		<li>Your sixth (6) strike will result in the consideration of a permanent ban. Multiple staff will discuss whether or not you should be banned. If banned, you will not have access to our website nor will you be welcomed to use our website anymore. If staff decide not to ban you, you will instead earn another suspension.</li>
		<li>Every strike after the sixth (6) one will result in another consideration for permanent ban or suspension.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In addition, staff may decide to silence you from a forum or topic for a period of time if the violation happened in the forums. Staff may also restrict your privileges depending on the rules violated.</li>
	<li>In addition, staff may issue a period of probation time if the need is present. During probation, your access to our website will be limited. Most content you submit during probation time will require staff approval before it is fully submitted.</li>
	<li>Staff will generally follow these guidelines, but do not have to. It is the staff&#39;s discretion to decide what to do and what is best and most fair.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Note about Discipline[/title]</kbd>Because of the nature of this website, in order to protect the security, safety, and integrity of The Lovinity Community+ and its members, our staff are strict/picky when it comes to rule enforcement. On the same note however, The Lovinity Community+ takes on an education-before-discipline approach. Discipline is only issued if staff feel the disciplinary action would be of benefit to the member and/or the community. We also don&#39;t ban users unless we feel it is absolutely necessary. A ban is seen as necessary if one of the following is true:

<ul>
	<li>All other methods of corrective behavior have been ineffective (warnings, point fines, permission restrictions, probation, suspension, etc.)</li>
	<li>The user clearly has no intention to follow the rules and intends to cause harm.</li>
	<li>It is obvious many users are bothered by such problematic user and a ban would be best to settle the conflicts.</li>
	<li>The user attempted or threatened website hacks, promoted or organized crime on-site, or engaged in sexual conversation with or posted sexual content of people under 18 years old.</li>
</ul>
<kbd class="cms_keep_block" title="title">[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Disciplinary Appeals[/title]</kbd>With most Disciplinary Actions given to you, you may file an appeal if you feel the decision made was unfair or you want to do good to get a little bit of a lift in your discipline. To file an appeal, create a support ticket (About -&gt; Support Tickets, or email support@lovinity.org ).<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Name of Appeal</th>
			<th scope="col">Description of Appeal</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Full</th>
			<td>Make a full appeal when you feel discipline was unfairly given to you. Include proof / justification as to why the discipline was unfair or unjust (apologies are not acceptable for a full appeal; see partial appeal). All disciplinary measures including the strike are removed in a successful full appeal; it essentially gets wiped from your records.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Partial</th>
			<td>File a partial appeal if you wish to complete a couple tasks given by the staff in exchange for having the points charged for your sanction returned to you. These tasks are meant to help you understand what you did as well as perform a form of giving back to the community. In a successful partial appeal, your points are returned, but any strikes, probation/suspension, or permission restrictions will remain in tact.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Suspension</th>
			<td>File a suspension appeal after your suspension time is up in order to have your suspension lifted. Then follow the instructions given to you by staff in a timely manner, which usually includes completing tasks to educate you on what we do and do not tolerate. Compliance is necessary in the appeal. Failure to complete the appeal will result in an extension of the suspension or a permanent ban.</td>
