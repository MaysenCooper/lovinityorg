<h2>STAR members</h2>
Our community assigns a dynamic &quot;STAR stat&quot; to every user, which is a measurement of how engaging they have been in our community in the last 30 days compared to all other users. A STAR stat of 1 means they had average engagement compared to all other members. Members with a STAR stat of 2 or more are considered to be &quot;STAR members&quot;, or very active. Here is a list of the current top 5 STAR members:<br />
