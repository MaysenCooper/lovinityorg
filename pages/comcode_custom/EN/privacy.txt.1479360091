<h2>Notes on what is done with information you submit</h2>
We will not share private details other than what can be seen in the forum profile and public postings unless legally required to do so.<br />
<br />
The staff reserve the right to read any Private Topics and posts placed on this website. <strong>Any form of conversation made through this website should be considered viewable by staff.</strong> All private-posts and posts, whether &#39;deleted&#39; or not, are stored on the server and in backups and may be reviewed if we feel we have cause for an investigation. If you do want to keep something private, do not use our services for transmitting it. Situations involving investigations can be anything at our discretion, for example, to investigate specific incidents of our services being used for racism or harassment.

<h2>Emails</h2>
Our website sends out email notifications to our members for different website activity. Some of these notifications may be changed in terms of settings from your profile. Others cannot be changed. To see what settings can and cannot be changed, see&nbsp;<a class="user_link" href="https://lovinity.org/catalogues/entry/website-functionality/what-notifications-can.htm">This FAQ entry on notification settings</a>&nbsp;.<br />
The Lovinity Community+ also sends weekly newsletters to everyone of the latest website news. We may also send bulk emails for high priority news.<br />
We will not send email to others which we would consider to be spam.<br />
&nbsp;
<h2>Content Title Privacy Disclaimer</h2>
You should assume that the titles of any content can be viewable by anyone, including guests, even if the content itself cannot. The reason being is because the Activity Feed does not regard privacy settings when making notices that members create new content (however should a member without access try to click it, they will receive an access denied error). This also includes titles of private topics.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
In order for children under the age of thirteen to join this website, a parent or guardian must approve it. This is in accordance with U.S. law, but is applied internationally as a civil standard.<br />
A notice will be sent, by e-mail, to the e-mail address given when a child joins, which will provide notice on how to approve the membership.<br />
<br />
The parent or guardian has the option to agree to the collection and use of the child&#39;s information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.<br />
<br />
{$SITE_NAME} may not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.<br />
<br />
The parent or guardian can review the child&#39;s personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child&#39;s information. This may be done by contacting the staff in the same way as was done to approve the membership originally.{+END}<br />
