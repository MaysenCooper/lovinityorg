Do you have a bunch of points that you have no use for? We now offer a limited way for you to be able to cash out some of your points into U.S. Dollars. To cash out points to money, please create a support ticket under help -&gt; Tickets / Contact, or email support@lovinity.org . In your message, include the number of points you want to cash out, as well as a link or an email address to your PayPal account so we can pay you via. PayPal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The lovinity Community+ has a very limited budget. The amount you see at the top of the page is edited to reflect the current amount of money we have available to give out in exchange for points. We will not accept requests to cash out points that exceed the amount we have available as stated above. Frequently, we won&#39;t have any money in the budget unfortunately, but keep checking back because sometimes we will have some in budget! When people donate to TLC+ or when TLC+ receives money by other means, then frequently there will be a little bit available for cashing out.<br />
