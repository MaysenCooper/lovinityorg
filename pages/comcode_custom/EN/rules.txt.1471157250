<ul>

</ul>
[title param=&quot;2&quot;]Accountability / Disciplinary System[/title]Here on The Lovinity Community+, we take a rather unique approach to handling rule violations. Unlike many websites out there that focus solely on staff intervention and discipline, we feel that approach does not help others learn from their mistakes and learn personal accountability. Therefore, our approach is &quot;<strong>accountability before punishment</strong>&quot;. And here&#39;s how it works:[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Accountability[/title]When a user violates a rule, the staff of The Lovinity Community+ will usually give the user a chance to <strong>take personal accountability for their actions</strong> before any discipline is considered. The exception is for very severe rule violations requiring immediate measures, such as severe spamming, or compromising website security. A user who has violated rules frequently and does not show care may also be an exception.<br />
<br />
Users who violate a rule and are given a chance to take personal accountability for their actions will be issued an &quot;Accountability Statement&quot; by staff via. Private Topics. An Accountability Statement outlines the following information:
<ul>
	<li>What content was found to be in violation of the rules</li>
	<li>What rules were violated and why the rules are important</li>
	<li>What initial discipline was issued, if any.
	<ul>
		<li>Usually, initial discipline includes measures to prevent further complications from arising as a result of the violation, such as content hiding, silencing from topics or forums, locking of topics, or probation time. For some violations, an initial reduction in Karma may also be issued.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>What the user needs to do to take personal accountability for their actions (such as writing apologies) and how much time has been given&nbsp;by staff to do so.</li>
	<li>What the user needs to do if they disagree with the accusation.</li>
	<li>The statement that the user needs to comply to avoid prosecution/discipline by staff (in some cases, discipline may still be issued depending on the violation regardless whether or not a user complies, but the discipline will be more severe if they do not take personal accountability)</li>
</ul>
<br />
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Punishment (Prosecution)[/title]If the user does not comply with the request for personal accountability, or if the rule violation is considered severe enough to warrant an immediate prosecution, then staff will issue the user a&nbsp;prosecution statement&nbsp;via. Private Topics. A <strong>prosecution statement</strong> consists of information outlining that the user violated the rules (and refused to take personal accountability, if applicable), and as a result, staff needed to issue disciplinary measures. A prosecution statement outlines the following information:

<ul>
	<li>What content was found to be in violation of the rules</li>
	<li>What rules were violated and why the rules are important</li>
	<li>What discipline was issued</li>
	<li>What the user needs to do next to prevent further problems in the future</li>
	<li>Whether or not the discipline can be appealed, and if so, how.</li>
</ul>
Discipline for prosecutions can vary depending on the type and severity of the rule violation:

<ul>
	<li>All prosecutions result in loss of karma and a fine of points.</li>
	<li>In addition, staff may decide to silence the user&nbsp;from a forum or topic for a period of time if the violation happened in the forums. Staff may also restrict their&nbsp;privileges depending on the rules violated.</li>
	<li>In addition, staff may issue a period of probation time if the need is present. During probation, the user&#39;s&nbsp;access to our website will be limited. Most content they&nbsp;submit during probation time will require staff approval before it is fully submitted/visible.</li>
	<li>Staff will generally follow these guidelines, but do not have to. It is the staff&#39;s discretion to decide what to do and what is best and most fair. For example, if a user is causing a severe problem, staff may bypass the warrant stage and immediately prosecute.</li>
</ul>
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Karma[/title]In the above sections, you may have noticed the reference to Karma.&nbsp;<strong>Karma</strong> is The Lovinity Community+&#39;s way to gauge where users stand in terms of following the rules and regulations on our website.

<ul>
	<li>Every user starts off at the highest level of Karma (100).</li>
	<li>Your karma level is&nbsp;a percentage&hellip; between 0 and 100, with 100 being best.</li>
	<li>When a user violates a rule, his/her karma might be reduced. The severity of the rule violation determines by how much their karma is reduced.</li>
	<li>Karma can be brought back up slowly over time by logging in to the website on a daily basis. For each day you log in, your Karma raises by 2 points.</li>
	<li>Karma may determine what special privileges and features a user will be allowed access to.</li>
	<li>Requirements for applying for staff also require a minimum Karma level at the time of application, depending on the position applying for.</li>
	<li>The first time a user reaches a Karma&nbsp;of 0, the user will be suspended for 7-14 days and must complete educational tasks after that time in order to return to the community.</li>
	<li>The second+ time a user reaches a Karma&nbsp;of 0, the user will be considered for a permanent ban. If banned, the user will no longer be welcomed in the community. If a permanent ban is not issued, another suspension will be issued instead.</li>
	<li>After a suspension is expired and appealed from&nbsp;karma 0, the user will return to the website with 20 points of karma.</li>
</ul>
Only yourself and staff who have permission to issue discipline can see your karma level. You can view your current karma level by going to your profile&#39;s about page. It is located under your avatar.<br />
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Note about Discipline[/title]Because of the nature of our website, we take rule violations seriously and will intervene should there be an issue. On the same note, we also believe in <strong>second chances</strong>. We aim to educate rather than simply punish. We also don&#39;t ban users unless we feel it is absolutely necessary. A ban is seen as necessary if one of the following is true:

<ul>
	<li>All other methods of corrective behavior have been ineffective (warnings, point fines, permission restrictions, probation, suspension, etc.)</li>
	<li>The user clearly has no intention to follow the rules and intends to cause harm.</li>
	<li>It is obvious many users are bothered by such problematic user and a ban would be best to settle the conflicts.</li>
	<li>The user attempted or threatened website hacks, promoted or organized crime on-site, or engaged in sexual conversation with or posted sexual content of people under 18 years old.</li>
</ul>
[title param=&quot;3&quot;]Disciplinary Appeals[/title]With most Disciplinary Actions / Prosecutions given to you, you may <strong>file an appeal</strong> if you feel the decision made was unfair. To file an appeal, create a support ticket (About -&gt; Support Tickets, or email support@lovinity.org ) or reply to the private topic that you received when you were issued discipline.<br />
<br />
It is a requirement that all appeals filed to us are reviewed by multiple staff to help ensure fairness.<br />

	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Full</th>
			<td>Make a <strong>full appeal</strong> when you feel discipline was unfairly given to you. Include proof / justification as to why the discipline was unfair or unjust (apologies are not acceptable for a full appeal; see partial appeal). All disciplinary measures including the karma are removed/recovered in a successful full appeal; it essentially gets wiped from your records.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Suspension</th>
			<td>File a <strong>suspension appeal</strong> after your suspension time is up in order to have your suspension lifted. Then follow the instructions given to you by staff in a timely manner, which usually includes completing tasks to educate you on what we do and do not tolerate. Compliance is necessary in the appeal. Failure to complete the appeal will result in an extension of the suspension or a permanent ban.</td>
