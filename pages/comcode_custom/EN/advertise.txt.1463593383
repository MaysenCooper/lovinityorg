<h2>Banner Advertising</h2>
At the top of every page on our website is a banner. You can create a banner ad for us to randomly display up there. Users can then click on the ad to be taken to a website of your choice.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Banner ads must be jpg, gif, or png images the size of 728x90 pixels.</li>
	<li>All website rules apply to the content you put in your banner.</li>
	<li>Your banner may not redirect users to malicious websites. We will check a website&#39;s reputation prior to approving a banner ad.</li>
	<li>Payment must be made in advance; we do not offer &quot;pay-as-they-click&quot;.</li>
	<li>Banners may not advertise actual prices for products or services, include comparison language (aka. &quot;We are the best there is&quot; or &quot;better than X company&quot;), nor include calls to action (aka. &quot;Buy our products&quot;). We are a non-profit entity.</li>
	<li>Banners may not endorse any political parties or candidates.</li>
	<li>Banners may not promote anything seen to be against progressive activism, such as discriminatory issues or fabrication of stereotypes (sexualized&nbsp;women&nbsp;for example).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs</h3>
You may pay for banner advertisements using U.S. Dollar equivalence (PayPal), or by using your website points. Here is our current rates, subject to change without notice:<br />

*The importance modulus determines how often in random logic that the banner appears on the website&hellip; the higher the modulus, the more often it shows up. A banner with a modulus of 2 will show up 2X as often as one with a modulus of 1&hellip; and one with a modulus of 4 will show up 2X as often as one with 2, and 4X as much as one with 1&hellip; and so on.
