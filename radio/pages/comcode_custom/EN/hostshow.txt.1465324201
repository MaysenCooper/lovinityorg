[semihtml][title]Host Your Own Radio Show[/title]
The Lovinity Community Radio is equipped with the capability to allow other people to host their own shows on our stream.<br />
&nbsp;
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
First off, our radio system is capable of hosting 4 different kinds of shows: Syndicated, live, pre-recorded, and podcast.&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Simulcast shows: These are shows that exist on other internet radio stations but are re-broadcast through The Lovinity Community Radio.</li>
	<li>Live shows: Using a couple of software programs and a microphone, you can stream audio to our radio system which will then go out on our internet radio stream.</li>
	<li>Pre-recorded: Prior to show time, you record the show and then upload it to our radio system.</li>
	<li>Podcast: Our radio station will query podcast feed and play the most recently added podcast episode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Radio Show Dashboard</h2>
Hosting shows on our station is rather easy thanks to the radio show dashboard.

<ul>
	<li>When you get a show with us, you will use the &quot;Radio Show Dashboard&quot; to manage your show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to queue your show and tell our station you will be airing a show this week.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to upload your pre-recorded audio to our radio system if you have a prerecorded show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to monitor the status of your show&hellip; see the details of your show, what the station time is, whether or not your show is on air and queued, how much time is left, and more.</li>
	<li>You will be using the dashboard to end your show early if you finish before the scheduled show end time.</li>
	<li>You will be using it to restart syndication or to restart the live stream if for whatever reason it stops on our internet station.</li>
	<li>You will also be using it for other functions as well over time as we program more into it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Any shows that air more than once per week is counted as multiple shows; for every time the show airs within a week, it counts as one show. This means in order to have a show that airs more than once per week, you will need to have donor status at the time you register your show.</li>
	<li>If you register multiple radio shows when in donor status and your donor status later expires, your radio shows will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be terminated. You may continue to run your shows as normal unless the show gets terminated for another reason.</li>
	<li>You must register special shows at least 14 days in advance.</li>
	<li>If you have a regular radio show presently, however you have a special episode coming up, you may register that specific air as a special show for a $5 donation by contacting us via. Support Tickets (About -&gt; Support Tickets, or email support@lovinity.org ) at least 14 days in advance. Getting special show status for your episode means a lot more promotion from our end as well as higher priority.</li>
