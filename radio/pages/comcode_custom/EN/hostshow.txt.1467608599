[semihtml][title]Host Your Own Radio Show[/title]
The Lovinity Community Radio is equipped with the capability to allow other people to host their own shows on our stream. You can air shows of virtually any type... all talk shows, hybrid talk/music shows, or all music shows. Please be aware that although we allow for shows with music to air, you are required by law to use only royalty-free or permissible Creative Commons or Fair/Free-use music on your show. <strong>Copyrighted music on your radio show is strictly prohibited</strong>&nbsp;and will result in immediate show termination and severe discipline, due to the high risk that playing copyrighted music has on us.<br />
&nbsp;
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
First off, our radio system is capable of hosting <strong>4 different kinds of shows</strong>: Syndicated, live, pre-recorded, and podcast.&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li><strong>Simulcast shows</strong>: These are shows that exist on other internet radio stations but are re-broadcast through The Lovinity Community Radio.</li>
	<li><strong>Live shows</strong>: Using a couple of software programs and a microphone, you can stream audio to our radio system which will then go out on our internet radio stream.</li>
	<li><strong>Pre-recorded</strong>: Prior to show time, you record the show and then upload it to our radio system.</li>
	<li><strong>Podcast</strong>: Our radio station will query podcast feed and play the most recently added podcast episode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Radio Show Dashboard</h2>
Hosting shows on our station is rather easy thanks to the <strong>radio show dashboard.</strong>

<ul>
	<li>When you get a show with us, you will use the &quot;Radio Show Dashboard&quot; to manage your show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>queue your show</strong> and tell our station you will be airing a show this week.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>upload your pre-recorded audio</strong> to our radio system if you have a prerecorded show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>monitor the status of your show</strong>&hellip; see the details of your show, what the station time is, whether or not your show is on air and queued, how much time is left, and more.</li>
	<li>You will be using the dashboard to <strong>end your show early</strong> if you finish before the scheduled show end time.</li>
	<li>You will be using it to <strong>restart syndication</strong> or to restart the live stream if for whatever reason it stops on our internet station.</li>
	<li>You will also be using it for other functions as well over time as we program more into it.</li>
</ul>
