[semihtml][title]Host Your Own Radio Show[/title]
The Lovinity Community Radio is equipped with the capability to allow other people to host their own shows on our stream. You can air shows of virtually any type&hellip; all talk shows, hybrid talk/music shows, or all music shows. Please be aware that although we allow for shows with music to air, you are required by law to use only royalty-free or permissible Creative Commons or Fair/Free-use music on your show, unless you have permission to stream licensed music. Illegally streaming music could result in immediate show termination and discipline.<br />
&nbsp;
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
First off, our radio system is capable of hosting <strong>4 different kinds of shows</strong>: Syndicated, live, pre-recorded, and podcast.&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li><strong>Simulcast shows</strong>: These are shows that exist on other internet radio stations but are re-broadcast through The Lovinity Community Radio.</li>
	<li><strong>Live shows</strong>: Using a couple of software programs and a microphone, you can stream audio to our radio system which will then go out on our internet radio stream.</li>
	<li><strong>Pre-recorded</strong>: Prior to show time, you record the show and then upload it to our radio system.</li>
	<li><strong>Podcast</strong>: Our radio station will query podcast feed and play the most recently added podcast episode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Radio Show Dashboard</h2>
Hosting shows on our station is rather easy thanks to the <strong>radio show dashboard.</strong>

<ul>
	<li>When you get a show with us, you will use the &quot;Radio Show Dashboard&quot; to manage your show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>queue your show</strong> and tell our station you will be airing a show this week.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>upload your pre-recorded audio</strong> to our radio system if you have a prerecorded show.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be using it to <strong>monitor the status of your show</strong>&hellip; see the details of your show, what the station time is, whether or not your show is on air and queued, how much time is left, and more.</li>
	<li>You will be using the dashboard to <strong>end your show early</strong> if you finish before the scheduled show end time.</li>
	<li>You will be using it to <strong>restart syndication</strong> or to restart the live stream if for whatever reason it stops on our internet station.</li>
	<li>You will also be using it for other functions as well over time as we program more into it.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Any shows that <strong>air more than once per week</strong> is counted as multiple shows; for every time the show airs within a week, it counts as one show. This means in order to have a show that airs more than once per week, you will need to have donor status at the time you register your show.</li>
	<li>If you <strong>register multiple radio shows</strong> when in donor status and your donor status later expires, your radio shows will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be terminated. You may continue to run your shows as normal unless the show gets terminated for another reason.</li>
	<li>You must register <strong>special shows</strong> at least 14 days in advance.</li>
	<li>If you have a <strong>regular radio show presently</strong>, however you have a special episode coming up, you may register that specific air as a special show for a $5 donation by contacting us via. Support Tickets (About -&gt; Support Tickets, or email support@lovinity.org ) at least 14 days in advance. Getting special show status for your episode means a lot more promotion from our end as well as higher priority.</li>
