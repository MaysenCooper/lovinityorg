[semihtml][title]Guided Meditations[/title]
Tune in to The Lovinity Community+ virtually every morning at 10am ET, afternoon at 4pm ET, and evening at 10pm ET, for guided meditations. Spend 10-30 minutes with us as we take you in a guided meditation journey to help you improve your well-being, ease away fears and doubts, and help you think clearly.<br />
<br />
Tune in every Sunday at 9am ET or 3pm ET to learn all about meditation: what it is, how it can benefit you, and what techniques and items you could use during a meditation.<br />
<br />
These meditations are brought to you by the Meditation Bible by Madonna Gauding.<br />
<br />
