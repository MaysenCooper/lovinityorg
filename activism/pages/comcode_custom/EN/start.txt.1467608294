<h2>Requirements</h2>
There are only a couple requirements. First off, your <strong>karma</strong> must be 75% or better before you can request an activist section (<a href="https://lovinity.org/catalogues/entry/rules-and-policies/what-is-karma">what is Karma?</a>). In addition, we ask that you <strong>actively maintain and submit content</strong> relating to the activist cause or movement. Any activist sections or websites found to go more than a month without activity may be subject to removal by The Lovinity Community+ in order to maintain freshness of our website.<br />
